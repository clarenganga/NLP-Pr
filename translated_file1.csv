“Flora alipotoka kanisani na watoto aliwarudisha nyumbani kisha akaondoka na kwenda hotelini kwa sababu alikuwa na ‘stress’ (mawazo) lakini akiwa huko alipigiwa simu na mdogo wake Suzan (shahidi wa pili) akimueleza kile alichoambiwa na binti huyo,” alisema Katuga.
Alisema Flora baada ya kuambiwa jambo hilo kwa simu alimwambia mdogo wake huyo ampeleke binti huyo katika hoteli iliyoko Sinza.
Alisema walipofika binti huyo alimsimulia tukio hilo la kubakwa na ndipo akawaambia waende wakatoe taarifa hizo kituo cha polisi kabla ya kwenda hospitalini.
Mahakama hiyo ilisikiliza ushahidi wa Flora kwa takriban saa nne.
Awali wapiga picha walizuiliwa na ndugu zake kumpiga picha huku wakidai kuwa watawashtaki.
“Mnataka kumpiga picha za nini, mmetumwa… mnajua sheria za nchi nyinyi,” alisikika mmoja wa ndugu zake.
Tukio hilo lilizua minong’ono mingi kutoka kwa wananchi waliofika mahakamani hapo kufuatilia kesi mbalimbali.
“Jamani kwani hawa si wapiga picha… waandishi si wanaruhusiwa kuchukua matukio na kwenda kuyaripoti kulikoni hawa wazuiliwe…jambo hili linashangaza kweli kweli,” alisema mwanamke mmoja ambaye hakutaka jina lake liandikwe gazetini.
Tukio hilo lilimshangaza pia Wakili George Mwalali aliyekuwa mahakamani hapo ambaye alisema kitendo hicho ni kosa.
“Haiwezekani mzuiliwe kupiga picha mpo sahihi kwa sababu hapa ni nje ya Mahakama, nitakwenda kuzungumza na wakili mwenzangu juu ya jambo hili,” alisema.
Baadaye ndugu hao wa Flora waliwafuata waandishi na kuwauliza kwa nini walikuwa wakipiga picha hizo na kudai kuwa walikuwa wakiwazuia kwa vile walipata taarifa kwamba kuna mtu amewapa fedha wapige picha hizo.
“Hapana ndugu yangu, sisi hakuna aliyetupatia fedha… tunachotaka ni habari hii na si vinginevyo,” alisema mmoja wa wapiga picha.
Mmoja wa ndugu hao alisema kilichokuwa kikiwaogopesha na kuamua kuzuia utekelezaji wa hatua hiyo ni kitendo cha baadhi ya waandishi kuweka kwenye mitandao ya jamii habari ambazo si sahihi.
“Kwa mfano zile picha zilizosambazwa mwanzoni zilitushangaza kwani si za huyu binti aliyebakwa, sijui walizitoa wapi, huko ni kuchafuliana majina,” alisema.
Baada ya ndugu hao kuridhishwa na ufafanuzi waliopewa na wapiga picha waliokuwa mahakamani hapo waliwaruhusu kuendelea na kazi yao.
Kesi hiyo iliahirishwa hadi April 16 mwaka huu itakapotajwa tena.","Veronica Romwald and Jacqueline Swai (RCT), Dar es Salaam
Gospel singer, Flora Mbasha has said she is ready to reconcile with her husband Emmanuel Mbasha, if he will fall at her feet and ask for forgiveness.
Flora said this yesterday when she spoke to journalists after she finished giving her evidence on the rape case facing Mbasha which is being heard in the Ilala District Court.
""Mbasha, I have forgiven him for many days and I am ready to live with him if he comes to fall at my feet and ask for my forgiveness... but this (rape) is a court issue,"" he said.
When asked about the legal father of her recently born baby girl, she said she could not talk about it right now.
""I can't talk about it. If I do that, I will be doing my son no justice. I can't change people's perceptions of the way they think about this matter,"" he said.
Government lawyer, Nassoro Katuga said earlier Flora gave her evidence before Judge Flora Mjaya and explained what was told by the girl who claims to have been raped by Mbasha.
Katuga was giving this explanation to the writers as the case is being heard in a secret court in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Act of 2003 chapter 20 section 186, subsection three to protect the daughter's right.
The lawyer said Flora told the Court that on May 23 last year, she found the daughter helpless while she was lying in bed and covered herself with a sheet.
He said he asked the girl if she was sick or not but she did not answer him.
Flora said the next day, May 24, she and the children at home left and went to church but Mbasha did not accompany them.
""When Flora left the church with the children, she brought them home and then left and went to the hotel because she was 'stressed' (thoughts) but while there she was called by her younger brother Suzan (the second witness) telling her what the girl told her,"" said Katuga.
He said that Flora, after being told about this on the phone, told her younger brother to take the daughter to a hotel in Sinza.
He said that when they arrived the girl told him about the incident of rape and then he told them to go and give the information to the police station before going to the hospital.
The court heard Flora's testimony for about four hours.
At first, photographers were prevented by his relatives from taking pictures of him while they claimed that they would sue them.
""What do you want to take pictures of, you have been sent... you know the laws of the country,"" said one of his brothers.
The incident caused many whispers from the citizens who came to the court to monitor various cases.
""Man, since these are not photographers... reporters are not allowed to take events and report them, why should they be detained... this is really surprising,"" said one woman who did not want her name to be published in the newspaper.
The incident also surprised Lawyer George Mwalali who was in court there who said the act was a mistake.
""It is impossible for you to be prevented from taking pictures because this is outside the Court, I will go and talk to my fellow lawyer about this matter,"" he said.
Later, Flora's brothers followed the reporters and asked them why they were taking those pictures and claimed that they were stopping them because they got information that someone had paid them to take those pictures.
""No my brother, no one gave us money... what we want is this information and nothing else,"" said one of the photographers.
One of the brothers said that what was scaring them and decided to prevent the implementation of the action was the act of some writers to put incorrect information on social networks.
""For example, the photos that were distributed at first surprised us because they are not of this girl who was raped, I don't know where they got them from, that is defaming each other's names,"" he said.
After the brothers were satisfied with the explanations given to them by the photographers in court, they allowed them to continue their work.
The case was adjourned until April 16 this year when it will be mentioned again."

" ZAIDI ya mabasi 2,840 yanayokwenda mikoa mbalimbali nchini yamefungwa mfumo maalumu wa ufuatiliaji wa mwenendo wake (VTS). Mfumo huo umeanza kutumika rasmi leo.Mfumo huo ulioanza Januari mwaka juzi kwa majaribio kwenye baadhi ya njia, ni maalumu kubaini madereva wanaoendesha zaidi ya kasi ya mwendo wa 80 kwa saa ili kuepusha ajali zinazotokana na mwendokasi.Mkurugenzi wa Mamlaka ya Udhibiti wa Usafiri wa Majini na nchi kavu (Sumatra), Gilliard Ngewe amesema wakati majaribio yalihusisha mabasi yanayotoka Dar es Salaam kwenda mikoa ya Kanda ya Ziwa, hivi sasa mabasi 2,840 yote nchini yameunganishwa.Ngewe amesema utafiti uliofanyika umebainisha upo umuhimu kutafuta njia za kudhibiti ajali.Alisema miongoni mwa utafiti ni pamoja na uliofanywa na Sumatra kwa kupitia taasisi ya BICO ya Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam, unaoonesha asilimia 76.4 za ajali hizo zilitokana na makosa ya kibinadamu.Kwa mujibu wa meneja wa mradi huo, Godfrey Nsato mfumo huo wa VTS ni muhimu kudhibiti madereva nchini na kupunguza ajali za barabani.Amesema mfumo huo utatoa hadhari iwapo dereva atatanua njia kwa lengo la kuwahi na akiwa kwenye mwendo wa kasi itampigia ishara ya kumjulisha kuwa amezidisha mwendo, itaonesha pia iwapo dereva alikuwa akienda hovyo barabarani, kutoa taarifa ya ajali na itamtambua dereva wa basi.Ametaja faida nyingine za mfumo huo kuwa umesaidia kupunguza matukio ya ajali, kupunguza athari za ajali na kupunguza matumizi ya mafuta kwenye mabasi.Hata hivyo Nsato alisema baadhi ya madereva wamekuwa wakihujumu mfumo huo na kusababisha athari za ufanisi.Alisema pia kuna uhitaji wa maboresho ya elimu, udhibiti na usimamizi wa sheria kwa madereva na watumiaji wengine wa barabarani. Hii ni kutokana na utafiti huo kubaini kuwa baadhi ya madereva hawapatiwi mafunzo ya kutosha.Waziri wa Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano, Dk Isack Kamwelwe ambaye alikuwa mgeni rasmi katika uzinduzi huo, alisema wadau wote nchini waungane kuhakikisha wanamaliza tatizo la ajali barabarani.Kamwelwe ameagiza kila mmiliki wa basi kuwa mwaminifu na kufunga mabasi yake mfumo huo na iwapo itabainika kuwa kuna waliokiuka, Sumatra iwachukulie hatua kali kwa mujibu wa sheria.Kamwelwe ameshauri pia magari yote ya serikali na daladala kufungwa VTS na kwamba serikali inaunga mkono juhudi za kuhakikisha ajali za barabarani zinapungua zaidi kama sio kumalizika.","MORE than 2,840 buses going to various regions in the country have been fitted with a special system for monitoring their behavior (VTS).

However, Nsato said some drivers have been sabotaging the system and causing efficiency effects. He also said there is a need for improvements in education, control and law enforcement for drivers and other road users. This is due to the research that found that some drivers are not given enough training. The Minister of Transport and Communications, Dr. Isack Kamwelwe, who was an official guest at the launch, said that all stakeholders in the country should unite to ensure that they end the problem of road accidents.

 MIGOGORO katika mahusiano ya ndoa ni jambo lisiloepukika. Hakujawahi kutokea watu wawili wenye vichwa tofauti wakaafikiana kwa kila jambo.  Kutofautiana kupo lakini tunafahamu kuwa hatua madhubuti zisipochukuliwa mapema kuondoa tofauti hizi ndoa in- aweza kukumbwa na tufani.  Inapofikia hatua hiyo wanandoa wanaweza kujikuta wakilazimika kuwahusisha watu wengine katika matatizo yao kwa sababu kadhaa.  Mosi, ni kuwasaidia kutatua mgogoro uliopo. Mmojawapo anapoomba msaada wa ndugu na jamaa wengine kwa mfano, analenga kupata msaada wa mawazo yatakayochangia kutatua changamoto zilizojitokeza.  Hata hivyo, si mara zote mwaliko huo wa watu wengine hulenga kutatua matatizo, wakati mwingine nia ya kuwaambia wengine huwa ni kutafuta huruma. Kwamba anapowaambia watu hali halisi kimsingi halengi kupata suluhu ya mgogoro unaoendelea ndani ya ndoa bali kutafuta faraja ya kisaikolojia kuwa anaonewa.  Katika mazingira ambayo
ndoa iko kwenye mgogoro kwa
sababu yoyote ile ni rahisi kwa
wazazi kufikia hatua ya kuwa-
husisha watoto wao kwenye
matatizo yao.
 Ninaomba kukushawishi kuwa jaribio lolote la kuwahu- sisha watoto na matatizo yenu si busara na inaweza kuleta mtafaruku mkubwa zaidi.  Jambo la kuzingatia ni kwamba changamoto yoyote mnayo- kumbana nayo kama wanandoa inawahusu ninyi wawili.  Matatizo yenu hayawahusu
watoto wenu ingawa ni kweli
unaweza kujaribiwa kutafuta
huruma ya watoto ukweli ni
kwamba kufanya hivyo ni kukosa
ukomavu.
 Katika mipaka ya makala
haya mtoto ni mtu anayeendelea
kukua kiufahamu na kimwili na
anayetegemea msaada wa wazazi
akiishi chini ya mamlaka yao.
 Kuwaingiza watoto kwenye mgogoro kunaweza kutafsiriwa kama kuwapa watoto taarifa zisizo za lazima kuhusu mgogoro wenu kwa lengo la kuwafanya wajue nani ni mkosaji na yupi hana hatia.  Mfano, baba anapowajulisha watoto kuwa anaachana na mama yao hiyo haimaanishi kuwa anawaingiza watoto kwe- nye mgogoro, lakini anapowapa watoto maelezo ya kina ya kiini na historia ya mgogoro ili kuwafanya waelewe nani amefanya nini kumwonea nani, hapo tunasema anawaangiza watoto kwenye mgogoro usiowahusu.  Unaweza kuwapa taarifa hizi
kwa lengo jema la kuwaelewesha
kwa nini mnaachana lakini akili
ya mtoto ikajenga msimamo
dhidi ya mzazi mmojawapo.
 Hatari kubwa ya kufanya hivi
ni kuwafanya watoto wachukue
upande.
 Hali hii inaweza kuonekana kuwa jambo dogo lakini ikawa na athari kwa maisha ya mtoto kwa mfano, kwa kugundua kosa la mmoja wenu mtoto anaweza kujenga chuki na kisasi kitakachoathiri maamuzi yake ya ndoa. ","BWAYA CHRISTIAN
 CONFLICTS in marital relations is inevitable. It has never happened that two people with different heads agreed on everything. There are differences, but we know that if concrete steps are not taken early to eliminate these differences, the marriage can be hit by a storm. When it gets to that point, couples may find themselves having to involve other people in their problems for a number of reasons. Mosi, is to help them solve the existing crisis. When one of them asks for the help of other relatives and friends, for example, he aims to get the help of ideas that will contribute to solving the challenges that have arisen. However, the invitation of other people is not always aimed at solving problems, sometimes the intention of telling others is to seek sympathy. That when he tells people the real situation, he is basically not aiming to find a solution to the ongoing conflict in the marriage, but to find psychological comfort that he is being bullied. In an environment that

 I would like to convince you that any attempt to involve your children in your problems is not wise and can lead to greater confusion. The thing to remember is that any challenge you face as a couple is about both of you. Your problems are not about you

 Bringing children into conflict can be interpreted as giving children unnecessary information about your conflict with the aim of making them know who is guilty and who is innocent. For example, when a father informs the children that he is divorcing their mother, that does not mean that he is bringing the children into a conflict, but when he gives the children a detailed explanation of the essence and history of the conflict to make them understand who has done what to whom, then we say that he is bringing the children into a conflict that does not concern them. You can give them this information

 Great risk of doing this
is to make the children take

 This situation may seem like a small matter, but it has an impact on the child's life, for example, by discovering the fault of one of you, the child may develop hatred and revenge that will affect his marriage decisions."

"Beijing, China MTOTO mchanga nchini China ameambukizwa virusi vya corona saa 30
baada ya kuzaliwa. Kisa hicho kinaandika rekodi ya mtoto mchanga zaidi kuwahi
kurekodiwa. Mtoto huyo alizaliwa Februari 2 katika hospitali moja ya mjini Wuhan,
ambako ndiko kitovu cha mlipuko wa virusi hivyo. Mama wa mtoto alikutwa na virusi hivyo kabla ya kujifungua.  Haijulikani ni kwa namna gani kichanga hicho kiliambukizwa. Shirika la habari la China, Xinhua limeripoti taarifa za maambukizi hayo
juzi Jumatano. Ilieleza kuwa mtoto huyo aliyekuwa na uzito kilogramu 3.25, alikuwa
na hali nzuri na alikuwa akifanyiwa uchunguzi. Wataalamu wa afya wanasema inawezekana ni maambukizi yaliyotokea
tumboni. ”Hii inatukumbusha kuwa makini kuwa kuna uwezekano kukawa na
maambukizi ya virusi vya corona kutoka kwa mama kwenda kwa mtoto.” Daktari wa
hospitali ya watoto kitengo cha dawa, Zeng Lingkong aliliambia shirika la
habari la Reuters. Lakini pia inawezekana mtoto aliathirika baada ya kuzaliwa na kuwa
karibu na mama yake. ”Inawezekana kuwa mtoto alipata maambukizi kwa njia za kawaida- kwa
kuvuta hewa iliyotoka kwa mama alipokohoa,” daktari wa magonjwa ya maambukizi
Stephen Morse ameeleza. Watoto wachache sana wamegundulika kuwa na virusi vya corona katika
mlipuko wa hivi karibuni, sawa na aina nyingine ya maradhi ya Sars na Mers. Ripoti ya jarida la kitabibu limesema wastani wa umri wa wagonjwa ni
kati ya miaka 49 na 56, kwa upande wa watoto ni mara ”chache sana”. Vivyo hivyo, wakati wa mlipuko wa Mers mwaka 2016, Jarida la afya
kuhusu maradhi ya watoto lilisema kuwa virusi vilikuwa vikiwaathiri watoto kwa
nadra sana, hata hivyo sababu hazijulikani. Mtoto wa miezi sita nchini Singapore aligundulika kuwa na virusi vya
corona , halikadhalika mtoto wa miaka minane aligundulika kuwa na virusi hivyo
mjini Wuhan, ambaye kwa sasa yuko Australia. Virusi hivyo vimesambaa nje ya China tayari mataifa 27 yamethibitisha
kuwa na visa 191 vya maambukizi na vifo viwili pekee nje ya China. MAELFU WATENGWA  Wakati huo huo maelfu ya watu wameendelea kuwekwa kwenye karantini
ndani ya meli mbili za abiria nchini Japan na Hong Kong, kutokana na mlipuko wa
virusi vya Corona.  Katika meli ya abiria nchini Japan, watu wengine 10 wamethibitishwa
kuwa na virusi hivyo na hivyo kuongeza idadi ya walioambukizwa kwenye meli hiyo
kufikia 20, na kufikisha idadi jumla ya walioambukizwa nchini Japan kuwa 45.  Haya yanajiri wakati maofisa wa afya wakisema jana kuwa idadi ya vifo
kutokana virusi hivyo imeongezeka kupindukia watu 500.  Takriban abiria 3,700 na wahudumu wa meli ya Diamond Princess,
wamewekwa kwenye karantini Pwani ya Yokohama, kusini mwa mji wa Tokyo.
Jumamosi, abiria mmoja aliyeshuka kwenye meli hiyo, alithibitishwa kuwa na
virusi hivyo.","Beijing, China A young child in China has been infected with the corona virus at 30
after birth. The case sets the record for the youngest child ever
to be recorded. The child was born on February 2 in a hospital in Wuhan,
which is the center of the outbreak of the virus. The child's mother was diagnosed with the virus before giving birth. It is not known how the child was infected. The Chinese news agency, Xinhua, has reported information about the infection
the other day on Wednesday. It explained that the child, who weighed 3.25 kilograms, was
and in good condition and was being examined. Health experts say it is possible that the infection occurred
in the womb. ”This reminds us to be careful that there is a possibility that there will be
transmission of the corona virus from mother to child."" Doctor of
children's hospital medicine department, Zeng Lingkong told the organization
Reuters news. But it is also possible that the child was affected after birth
close to his mother. ""It is possible that the child got the infection in the usual ways - by
inhaling the air that came out of the mother when she coughed,” an infectious disease doctor
Stephen Morse has explained. Very few children have been diagnosed with the corona virus
recent outbreak, similar to other types of Sars and Mers diseases. A medical journal report said the average age of patients is
between 49 and 56 years, in the case of children it is ""very few"" times. Likewise, during the Mers outbreak in 2016, the Health Journal
about children's diseases it said that the virus was affecting children for
Very rare, however the cause is unknown. A six-month-old baby in Singapore was found to have the virus
corona, likewise an eight-year-old child was found to have the virus
in Wuhan, who is currently in Australia. The virus has spread outside of China and 27 countries have already confirmed it
having 191 cases of infection and only two deaths outside of China. THOUSANDS ARE ISOLATED At the same time, thousands of people have continued to be quarantined
inside two passenger ships in Japan and Hong Kong, due to the explosion of
Corona virus. On a passenger ship in Japan, another 10 people have been confirmed
having the virus and thus increasing the number of infected on the ship
reached 20, bringing the total number of infected in Japan to 45. This is happening when health officials said yesterday that the number of deaths
due to the virus has increased to over 500 people. Approximately 3,700 passengers and crew members of the Diamond Princess ship,

walikuwa wakisubiri wateja wamalize kula na kufuatilia makombo, lakini kadiri
muda ulivyozidi kwenda wakaanza tabia ya kudonoa vyakula vikiwa mikononi mwa
wateja. Hivyo, ubunifu wa
kutumia bastola za maji umesaidia kupunguza tatizo hilo kwa kiasi kikubwa. Evans anasema
kabla ya ubunifu huo, alitumia mabomu feki ya kielektroniki pamoja na bundi
feki, lakini ni bastola ndizo zilizoweza kufanya kazi ipasavyo. Inasemekana kila
meza huwekewa bunduki hizo za maji na sasa wateja wameridhishwa na uwezo wake
wa kuwafukuza ndege hao kwa njia ambayo pia huwaburudisha. Bila shaka,
wawekezaji katika sekta ya utalii katika majiji kama Dar es Salaam wanaweza
kuiga mbinu hii au wavumbue mbinu nyingine bora zaidi. Mbinu hizo zitaua

visa vya maambukizi ya virusi vya Corona duniani  vimepindukia mamilioni kwa mamilioni. Watafiti
wanasema kufikia sasa ni asilimia 6% tu ya mambukizi hayo ambayo yamegundugulika.
 Kulingana na
utafiti huo, Christian Bommer na Sebastian Vollmer wa chuo kikuu cha Göttingen
Ujerumani, wamechunguza data za gazeti la kila mwezi la Lancet ambalo hutoa
taarifa kuhusu magonjwa ya kuambukizwa. Kulingana na
watafiti hao, data hizo zilionyesha kuwa huenda mataifa yamegundua tu asilimia
6% ya maambukizi hayo.  Wanasema
idadi jumla ya virusi vya Corona huenda imependukia mamilioni kote duniani.  Wanasema
kufikia sasa huenda virusi vya Corona vimeishawaambukizi mamilioni ya watu
duniani.  “Matokeo
haya yanamaanisha kuwa serikali zote na watungaji sheria wanapaswa kuwa makini
sana wakati wakitoa idadi ya visa vya maambukizi ili waweze kurahisishwa katika
kupanga mikakati ya kushughulikia visa hivyo. “Alisema Vollmer, profesa wa
idara ya Maendeleao na Uchumi katika chuo hicho. Utafiti huo
unakadiria kuwa kufikia Machi 31, 2020, Ujerumani ilikuwa na visa vipatavyo
460,000 vya mambukizi ya virusi vya Corona.  Aidha
unabainisha kuwa siku hiyo hiyo Marekani ilikuwa na zaidi ya milioni 10 ya
maambukizi hayo, huku nchini Hispania wakikadiria kuwa tayari kulikuwa na watu
milioni 5 wenye virusi hivyo.  Huko Italia,
nchi ambayo sasa ni kiini cha virusi hivyo, watafiti wanasema ilikuwa na visa
vipatavyo milioni 3 kufikia Machi 31 huku Uingereza ikiwa na maambukizi milioni
2. Kwa mujibu
wa data za chuo kikuu cha John Hopkins, iliripoti kutokea kwa visa 900,000 vya
maambukizi kote duniani siku hiyo.  Watafiti
Christian Bommer na Sebastian Vollmer wameeleza kuwa wakati data za chuo kikuu
cha Johns Hopkins zikieleza kutokea kwa maambukizi chini ya milioni moja mnamo
Machi 31, wanakadiria kuwa tayari kulikuwa na mamilioni ya maambukizi.  Kulingana na
watafiti hao, uhaba wa vifaa vya kupima virusi vya Corona pamoja na kuchelewa
kupima kumesababisha kutokea kwa vifo kadhaa katika mataifa ya Italia na
Uhispania, tofauti na Ujerumani ambako visa viligunduliwa mapema.  Ujerumani
imegundua takribani asilimia15% ya visa vyote ikilinganishwa na asilimia 3.5%
na 1.7% ya visa ambavyo vimegundliwa Italia na Uhispania, utafiti huo umebaini.
 Aidha
unaeleza kuwa idadi ya visa vilivyogunduliwa nchini Marekani na Uingereza
ilikuwa chini zaidi kwa asilimia 1.6% Marekani na huko Uingereza ikiwa tu kwa
1.2% Utafiti huo
umeeleza kuwa ni suala la muda tu, kubainika hali mbaya nyingine. Utafiti huo umetoa
wito kuyataka mataifa kuongeza juhudi za kupima na kugundua maambukizi mapya
mapema na kuchukua mikakati ikiwemo kuwatenga waathirika. “Ikiwa
mataifa yatashindwa kufanyia hivyo, huenda virusi hivyo vikabaki bila
kugunduliwa na kuweza kusababisha mripuko mwingine, ni suala la muda tu.”
Watafiti hao wametahadharisha.","BERLIN,
GERMANY RESEARCHERS
at the University of Göttingen in Germany have warned that it may
cases of Corona virus infection in the world have exceeded millions upon millions. Researchers
they say so far only 6% of the infections have been discovered.
 According to
the study, Christian Bommer and Sebastian Vollmer of the University of Göttingen
In Germany, they have analyzed the data of the monthly magazine Lancet that it provides
information about communicable diseases. According to
the researchers, the data showed that the states may have only discovered the percentage
6% of the infection. They say
The total number of Corona virus may have reached millions around the world. They say
By now, the Corona virus may have infected millions of people
in the world. ""Results
this means that all governments and law makers should be careful
very much when they give the number of cases of infection so that they can be simplified in
planning strategies to deal with those cases. ""Said Vollmer, professor of
Department of Development and Economics in the college. The research
you estimate that as of March 31, 2020, Germany had about
460,000 of Corona virus infections. In addition
you note that on the same day the United States had more than 10 million of
the infection, while in Spain they estimated that there were already people
5 million with the virus. In Italy,
the country that is now the epicenter of the virus, researchers say had cases
about 3 million by March 31 with the UK having a million infections

On March 31, they estimate that there were already millions of infections. According to
the researchers, the shortage of equipment to test the Corona virus as well as the delay
testing has caused several deaths in Italy and
Spain, unlike Germany where cases were detected earlier. Germany
detected about 15% of all cases compared to 3.5%
and 1.7% of cases have been detected in Italy and Spain, the study revealed.
 In addition

You have explained that it is only a matter of time, to find out another bad situation. The research has provided
calling on nations to increase efforts to test and detect new infections
early and take strategies including isolating the victims. ""If
nations will fail to do so, the virus may remain free
being discovered and being able to cause another explosion, it is only a matter of time.""

" Na JUDITH NYANGE MKOA wa Mwanza kwa kushirikiana na wadau mbalimbali wa afya umefanikiwa kupunguza kwa asilimia nne vifo vinavyotokana na   malaria kutoka asilimia 19.1 katika   miaka mine. Vifo hivyo vimefikia asilimia 15 mwaka 2015/16 kutoka asilimia 19 za mwaka 2011/12. Mganga Mkuu wa Mkoa waMwanza, Dk. Leornard Subi, alikuwa akizungumza wakati wa kugawa  vyandarua kwa wanafunzi wa Shule ya Msingi Senge,   Kata ya Bujashi  wilayani Magu ikishuhudiwa na wajumbe  wa Bunge la   Marekani. Dk. Subi alisema mwaka 2011/12 kiwango cha maambukizi ya malaria mkoani Mwanza kilikuwa   asilimia 19.1 lakini  kwa mujibu wa utafiti uliofanyika hadi kufikia mwaka 2015/16 kiwango hicho kimepungua na kufikia asilimia 15. Alisema   wanaoathirika zaidi ni wanawake wajawazito na watoto chini ya umri wa miaka mitano. Katika mapambano dhidi ya malaria makundi hayo yamepewa kipaumbele cha  pekee, alisema. Alisema  mkoa umeanzisha progaramu ya  ugawaji wa vyandarua katika vituo vya afya, hospitali, zahanati na kwenye shule kwa wanafunzi wa darasa la kwanza, nne, tano na sita  unaotekelezwa na serikali  kwa kushirikiana na Shirika la  Msaada la Marekani (USAID). “Hatudhibiti malaria kwa chandarua pekee yake tunatumia njia mbalimbali  ikiwamo kuwapatia tiba sahihi na kamili kwa wagonjwa wanaogundulika kuwa na malaria, kugawa dozi zaidi ya tatu za SP kwa wajawazito ili kudhibiti vimelea vya malaria. “Kwa sababu akipata ugonjwa huu anakuwa katika hatari ya kupoteza damu nyingi ambayo inaweza kumsababishia kifo. “Malaria ni hatari kwa sababu mtu akipata  vimelea vyake vinashambulia chembechembe nyekundu za damu ambapo inaweza ikaathiri figo, mwili kudhoofika, na baadaye husababisha mgonjwa kuishiwa damu,” alisema Dk. Subi. Mkurugenzi wa Mawasiliano kutoka USAID, Chriss Thomas, alisema  alifurahishwa na juhudi na mafanikio makubwa yaliyofikiwa na  serikali ya Tanzania katika kupambana na malaria. Aliahidi kusaidia zaidi mapambano hayo kuokoa maisha ya wajawazito na watoto walio kwenye hatari zaidi kutokana na ugonjwa huo. Wilaya za  Ukerewe na Buchosa ndizo zinazoongoza kwa kuwa na maambukizi makubwa ya malaria ambako   vyandarua zaidi ya 500,000 vimegawanywa katika shule 941, zahanati, vituo vya afya na hospitali.","By JUDITH NYANGE Mwanza Region in collaboration with various health stakeholders has succeeded in reducing by four percent the deaths caused by malaria from 19.1 percent in four years. The deaths have reached 15 percent in 2015/16 from 19 percent in 2011/12. Chief Medical Officer of Mwanza Region, Dr. Leonard Subi, was speaking during the distribution of nets to the students of Senge Primary School, Bujashi District, Magu district witnessed by members of the United States Parliament. Dr. Subi said in 2011/12 the rate of malaria infection in Mwanza region was 19.1 percent but according to the research conducted until 2015/16 the rate has decreased to 15 percent. He said the most affected are pregnant women and children under the age of five . In the fight against malaria, those groups have been given the only priority, he said. He said that the region has started a program for the distribution of bed nets in health centers, hospitals, clinics and schools for students in the first, fourth, fifth and sixth grades, implemented by the government in collaboration with the United States Aid Agency (USAID). ""We do not control malaria with mosquito nets alone, we use various methods, including providing accurate and complete treatment to patients diagnosed with malaria, giving more than three doses of SP to pregnant women to control malaria parasites. ""Because if he gets this disease he is at risk of losing a lot of blood which can cause his death. ""Malaria is dangerous because if a person gets it, its parasites attack the red blood cells where it can affect the kidneys, weaken the body, and later cause the patient to bleed,"" said Dr. Subi. Director of Communications from USAID, Chris Thomas, said he was pleased with the efforts and great achievements achieved by the Tanzanian government in fighting malaria. He promised to further support the fight to save the lives of pregnant women and children who are most at risk from the disease. The districts of Ukerewe and Buchosa are the leading districts with high malaria infection where more than 500,000 nets have been distributed in 941 schools, clinics, health centers and hospitals."
"Na VERONICA ROMWALD – DAR ES SALAAM  HATUA ya Rais Dk. John Magufuli kukemea hadharani wasanii wanaocheza utupu
majukwaani na wanaporekodi video za muziki ni ya kupongezwa.
Ni suala linalopaswa kuungwa mkono na kila mwananchi anayependa
maendeleo ya jamii na nchi kwa ujumla.
Akihutubia katika mkutano wa Jumuiya ya Wazazi wa Chama Cha Mapinduzi
juzi mjini Dodoma, Rais Magufuli alisema kila anapowasha televisheni
yake anashangaa kukutana na mabinti wakicheza utupu.
Alisema wakati mabinti wakicheza utupu, wanaume huwa wamevaa mavazi ya
staha na kusisitiza kwamba ni aibu kubwa kwa wazazi kuangalia mambo
hayo.
Pia aliitaka jamii kuamka na kuwakemea wale wanaofanya vitendo hivyo kwa kuwa
vinaashiria mmomonyoko wa maadili katika jamii.
Tamko hilo la Rais Dk. Magufuli linapaswa kuungwa mkono na kila mtu
anayependa maadili mema kwa sababu suala hili
limekuwa kero kubwa katika jamii.
Unaweza kukaa sebuleni kwako na kuamua kufungulia televisheni ili
kutazama muziki lakini ukakutana na wasichana warembo waliovaa
nusu utupu huku wakinengua, ubaya unakuja pale ambapo unakuwa na watoto.
Ni aibu isiyoelezeka, vyombo vya habari navyo vinapaswa kujitathmini
katika hili, kwa sababu miziki mingi imekuwa ikipigwa mchana na
wanenguaji wake huwa wamevaa utupu.
Tunalalamika na kutupiana mpira kila siku juu ya mmomonyoko wa
maadili, kila mmoja akimtuhumu mwenzake kuwa ni chanzo.
Lakini tunasahau kuna mambo kama hayo ambayo huchangia kwa namna moja
au nyingine kuwaathiri watoto na hivyo kujikuta tukiwa na kizazi
kisichokuwa na maadili.
Dk. Magufuli anashauri: “Ifike mahali bila kujali vyama vyetu, tulinde
maadili yetu, ninyi kama wazazi, sifahamu kama enzi za akina Fatma
Karume au kina Maria Nyerere huo ndio ulikuwa mtindo, lakini nina
uhakika enzi zile haikuwa hivyo, lakini vyombo vyetu vya habari,
wasimamizi wa maadili haya wako wapi? Wizara inayosimamia haya wako
wapi je, TCRA wako wapi? Niwaombe ndugu zangu jumuiya ya wazazi
kuikosoa hata serikali katika kusimamia maadili ya Tanzania.”
Naamini kila mmoja wetu ana wajibu katika kusimamia suala hili,
vinginevyo jamii itazidi kuharibiwa na maadili yatazidi kuporomoka
kila siku.
Kwa kuwa Rais Magufuli ametoa rai hiyo ni vema kila mmoja kuhakikisha anasimama katika nafasi yake ili siku moja tujivunie kizazi chenye maadili mema
kinachojali utu, uzalengo, amani na upendo.","By VERONICA ROMWALD – DAR ES SALAAM ACTION by the President Dr. John Magufuli to publicly reprimand artists who play in the void
on stage and when filming music videos is commendable.
It is an issue that should be supported by every interested citizen
the development of society and the country as a whole.
Addressing the meeting of the Parents' Association of Chama Cha Mapinduzi
the other day in Dodoma, President Magufuli said every time he turns on the television
his is surprised to meet daughters playing empty.
He said that while the girls are dancing, the men are wearing clothes
shame and emphasize that it is a great shame for parents to look into things
that.
He also called on the community to wake up and reprimand those who do such acts for being
they indicate the erosion of morals in society.
The declaration of the President Dr. Magufuli should be supported by everyone
who likes good values ​​because this issue
has become a big nuisance in society.
You can sit in your living room and decide to turn on the television
to watch music but you met beautiful girls wearing
half empty while they speak, evil comes when you have children.
It is an indescribable shame, the media should also evaluate itself
in this, because a lot of music has been played during the day and
his followers are always wearing nothing.
We complain and kick each other every day about the erosion of
values, each accusing the other of being the source.
But we forget that there are such things that contribute in the same way
or others to affect the children and thus find ourselves with a generation
unethical.
Dr. Magufuli advises: ""Let it reach a place regardless of our parties, let's protect it
our morals, you as parents, I don't know like the times of the Fatmas
Karume or kina Maria Nyerere was the style, but I have
that was not the case in those days, but our media,
Where are the managers of these values? The ministry in charge of these are you
Where are the TCRA? I ask my brothers for the community of parents
criticizing even the government in managing the values ​​of Tanzania.""
I believe each of us has a responsibility in managing this issue,
otherwise society will be further destroyed and morals will further collapse
everyday.
Since President Magufuli has given that opinion, it is good for everyone to ensure that they stand in their place so that one day we can be proud of a generation with good morals
that cares about humanity, objectivity, peace and love."

" MKATABA wa ujenzi wa daraja kuvuka ziwa Victoria ambalo linafahamika kama daraja la Kigongo – Busisi umesainiwa Dar es Salaam jana na kushuhudiwa na Waziri wa Ujenzi, Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano, Isack Kamwelwe. Daraja hilo ambalo litajengwa na kampuni ya China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) – East Africa Ltd itagharimu Sh bilioni 592 bila Kodi ya Ongezeko la Thamani (VAT).Daraja hilo litakuwa na urefu wa mita 3,200 sawa na kilometa 3.2, pamoja ujenzi wa barabara ya lami yenye urefu wa kilometa 1.66 huku ujenzi huo ukitarajiwa kukamilika ndani ya miezi 42 sawa na miaka minne. Akizungumza katika hafla hiyo ya utiaji saini, Mtendajji Mkuu wa Tanroads, Patrick Mfugale alisema daraja hilo ni kubwa kuliko madaraja yote nchini na litakuwa na nguzo kuu tatu zenye upana 160 na kutakuwa na ‘cables’ ambazo zitashikilia daraja kwa katikati kama ilivyo la Kigamboni, na litakuwa na uwezo wa kupita pikipiki, guta, magari madogo na makubwa kwa wakati mmoja.Alisema mradi huo daraja litakuwa kwenye barabara Kuu ya Usagala, Geita, Muziyarongo Kamyora,na lipo kilomita 34 kutoka mjini Mwanza Alisema juhudi za kujenga daraja hilo zilianza zamani, serikali ilikuwa inasaka fedha za kujenga lakini awamu zote ziligonga mwamba, na kwamba kwa miaka ya nyuma kujenga barabara na madaraja kwa fedha za ndani ni dhambi mpaka apatikane wafadhili wa kutoa mkopo au bure.“Nakumbuka mwaka 1979 serikali iliomba European Union lakini walitugomea wakasema daraja kubwa na halina faida, hali kadhalika hata benki ya dunia pia ilitugomea kwa kigezo hicho hicho,”alisema. Alisema Serikali ya Awamu ya Tano chini ya Rais John Magufuli imedhubutu na kukubali kulijenga daraja hilo linalopita kwenye mkondo wa ziwa victoria kwa fedha za ndani. Alisema litakuwa na urefu wa kilomita 3.2 na upana wa mita 28.45 litakuwa na njia mbili yani ya kwenda Busisi na kurudi “litakuwa na njia ya maegesho ya magari, njia ya wapita kwa miguu pande zote mbili na litakuwa na uwezo wa kubeba magari 10,200 kwa siku sawa na vivuko vitatu vya Misungwi, Sengerema na Mwanza.Hivi sasa hivi vivuko vinaudumia magari 1600 kwa siku,” alisema. Mfugale alisema endapo daraja hilo halitajengwa basi itabidi viongezwe vivuko vingine vitano ili kukidhi mahitaji na kwamba kujengwa kwa daraja hilo kutapunguza urefu wa barabara hadi kilomita 183 kwenda Geita, Kagera, Uganda, Rwanda na Burundi “Litapunguza muda wa safari kwa sasa kama kutoka Mwanza, Usagara unataka kuvuka si chini ya saa mbili na nusu kuvuka ili uwendelee na safari yako, ukitumia kivuko utatumia ‘maximum’ dakika nne kwa gari dogo na gari kubwa dakika sita,”alisema.Alisema daraja hilo litachochea shuguli nyingi za kiuchumi, ukizingatia juzi imefunguliwa hifadhi ya Burigi - Chato, kwa hiyo mtu atakayetoka Kenya akitaka kwenda kuangalia mbuga za wanyama muda wake utakuwa umepungua. Alisema pia muungano wa Afrika Mashariki sasa utakuwa umefikia pahala pake kwani daraja hili litarahisisha usafiri. Mfugale alisema kuwa kukamilika kwa ujenzi wa daraja hilo kutakuwa muarobaini wa usafiri kwenye eneo hilo ambako vivuko vimekuwa vikipata shida na kusababisha madhara makubwa kwa wananchi.Kampuni iliyojenga Daraja la Magufuli Kilombero na ile inayojenga barabara za juu katika makutano ya barabara Ubungo jijini Dar es Salaam nchini Tanzania ndizo zilizoshinda zabuni ya kutekeleza mradi huo. “Usanifu ulifanywa na kampuni nne, mbili za Kitanzania na mbili za Kikorea … waliochukua vitabu vya zabuni walikuwa 33 lakini waliorudisha walikuwa 11 tu, kampuni zilizoshinda ni hizi mbili na tuna imani na uwezo wake,” alisema Mfugale. Alisema Tanroads itasimamia vizuri mradi huo ambao utaanza mara moja ili ikiwezekana muda wa kukamilika upungue.Naye Mkuu wa Mkoa wa Mwanza, John Mongela akizungumza katika hafla hiyo alisema wakati Rais Magufuli ametangaza ujenzi wa daraja hilo wapo waliodhani ni miujiza lakini hatimae watanzania wanashuhudia utiaji saini. “Sisi tupo tayari tumeupokea mradi, na tutatoa ushirikiano utakapohitajika, Mwanza ndio kitovu cha biashara kwa Afrika Mashariki,” alisema","The CONTRACT for the construction of a bridge across Lake Victoria which is known as the Kigongo - Busisi bridge was signed in Dar es Salaam yesterday and witnessed by the Minister of Construction, Transport and Communications, Isack Kamwelwe. The bridge that will be built by the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) - East Africa Ltd will cost Shs 592 billion without Value Added Tax (VAT). The bridge will have a length of 3,200 meters equal to 3.2 kilometers, including road construction of asphalt with a length of 1.66 kilometers while the construction is expected to be completed within 42 months equal to four years. Speaking at the signing ceremony, the CEO of Tanroads, Patrick Mfugale said the bridge is bigger than all the bridges in the country and will have three main pillars with a width of 160 and there will be 'cables' that will hold the bridge in the middle like Kigamboni, and it will have the ability to pass motorcycles, trucks, small and large vehicles at the same time. He said that the project will be on the main road of Usagala, Geita, Muziyarongo Kamyora, and it is located 34 kilometers from Mwanza town. He said that efforts to build the bridge started a long time ago, the government it was looking for funds to build but all the phases hit a rock, and that in the past years building roads and bridges with local funds is a sin until donors are found to give loans or for free. it is not profitable, in the same way even the World Bank also boycotted us for the same criteria,"" he said. He said the Government of the Fifth Phase under President John Magufuli has dared and agreed to build the bridge that crosses the channel of Lake Victoria with local funds. He said it will be 3.2 kilometers long and 28.45 meters wide, it will have two ways to go to Busisi and back ""it will have a car parking path, a pedestrian path on both sides and it will have the capacity to carry 10,200 cars on the same day and the three crossings of Misungwi, Sengerema and Mwanza. Right now the crossings are handling 1600 vehicles per day,"" he said. Mfugale said if the bridge is not built then five more crossings will have to be added to meet the needs and that the construction of the bridge will reduce the length of the road to 183 kilometers to Geita, Kagera, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi ""It will reduce the travel time at the moment from Mwanza, Usagara you want to cross no less than two and a half hours to continue your journey, if you use the ferry you will spend a maximum of four minutes for a small car and six minutes for a large car,"" he said. He said that the bridge will stimulate many economic activities, considering that the reservoir was opened Burigi - Chato, so a person coming from Kenya who wants to go to see the zoos will have less time. He also said that the East African Union will now have reached its destination as this bridge will make travel easier. Mfugale said that the completion of the construction of the bridge will improve transport in the area where the crossings have been experiencing problems and causing serious harm to the people. Tanzania won the bid to implement the project. ""The design was done by four companies, two Tanzanian and two Korean... those who took the tender books were 33 but those who returned were only 11, the winning companies are these two and we have faith in their abilities,"" said Mfugale. He said that Tanroads will properly manage the project which will start immediately so that if possible the completion time will be reduced. Also the Head of Mwanza Region, John Mongela speaking at the event said that when President Magufuli announced the construction of the bridge there were those who thought it was a miracle but finally Tanzanians witnessed the signing. ""We have already received the project, and we will provide cooperation when needed, Mwanza is the center of business for East Africa,"" he said"

" Mchezo huo utakuwa ni wa mwisho katika mzungumko wa kwanza ambapo ligi itasimama kupisha michuano ya Kombe la Mapinduzi itakayoanza kutimua vumbi kuanzia keshokutwa visiwani Zanzibar.Simba inahitaji pointi tatu ili kuanza mwaka vizuri baada ya kupata sare katika michezo mitatu iliyopita iliyochezwa mwishoni mwa mwaka jana dhidi ya Mwadui bao 1-1, Toto African 1-1 na dhidi ya Azam Fc mabao 2-2.Ni wazi matokeo hayo hayaridhishi hivyo Simba inahitaji ushindi katika mchezo huo ili kufungua mwaka vizuri na kufanya vizuri katika michezo ya raundi ya pili itakayochezwa kuanzia Januari 16, mwaka huu.Aidha, Ndanda Fc haiko katika nafasi nzuri pia, kwani inashika nafasi ya 13 ikiwa na pointi tisa ambazo kama itaendelea kuruhusu kipigo, hali itazidi kuwa mbaya. Ndanda imeshinda mchezo mmoja pekee kati ya 12 iliyocheza huku ikipoteza michezo mitano na kupata sare sita.Katika michezo iliyopita, ilifungwa na JKT Ruvu mabao 3-1, dhidi ya Mwadui mabao 2-1 na kutoka sare dhidi ya Prisons mabao 2-2. Ili ijinasue kwenye janga la kushuka daraja hakika inahitaji ushindi katika mchezo huo.Msimu uliopita Simba iliwahi kuifunga Ndanda Fc nyumbani kwao mabao 2-0 na ule wa marudio ikaibamiza mabao 3-0 katika mchezo uliochezwa kwenye uwanja wa Taifa Dar es Salaam.Huenda kwa vile Ndanda itakuwa na hasira ya kufanya vibaya katika michezo iliyopita itaonyesha juhudi na kutaka kulipiza kisasi kwa Simba kwa kuhakikisha inapambana kupata matokeo mazuri.","The game will be the last in the first round where the league will stop to pass the Revolution Cup championship that will begin to kick off tomorrow in the islands of Zanzibar. Simba needs three points to start the year well after getting a draw in the last three games played at the end of last year against Mwadui scored 1-1, Toto African scored 1-1 and against Azam Fc scored 2-2. It is clear that the results are not satisfactory, so Simba needs a win in that game to open the year well and do well in the second round games that will be played from January 16 , this year. In addition, Ndanda Fc is not in a good position either, as it ranks 13th with nine points, which if it continues to allow defeat, the situation will get worse. Ndanda has won only one game out of 12 played while losing five games and getting six draws. In the previous games, it was won by JKT Ruvu 3-1 goals, against Mwadui 2-1 goals and from a draw against Prisons 2-2 goals. In order to get out of the relegation crisis, it definitely needs a win in that game. Last season, Simba beat Ndanda Fc at home 2-0 and in the second leg they beat them 3-0 in a game played at Taifa Dar es Salaam. It could be because Ndanda will be angry for doing badly in the previous games, it will show effort and want to take revenge on Simba by ensuring that it fights to get a good result."
"LEONARD MANG’OHADAR ES SALAAM CHAMA cha Wamiliki wa Mabasi Tanzania (TABOA), kimesema kimefikia hatua nzuri za kuanza kutumia mfumo wa kielektroniki wa kukata tiketi kama ilivyoagizwa na Serikali. Akitoa maazimio ya mkutano mkuu wa chama hicho ulioketi Dar es Salaam juzi, Katibu Mkuu wa Taboa, Enea Mrutu, alizitaja baadhi ya hatua zilizofikiwa ili kuanza kutumia mfumo huo kuwa ni pamoja na kupata kampuni tano zitakazotoa huduma katika kanda tano. Alisema leo wanatarajiwa kukaa na watoa huduma  ili kujadiliana kuhusu bei watakayowatoza kutokana na wanachama kudai  gharama ya asilimia 0.7, bado ni kubwa na baada ya hapo watoa huduma hao watakwenda mikoani kutoa elimu kwa watumiaji wa mfumo. “Hatuhitaji kuletewa mtu, sisi ni taasisi huru ambayo inaheshimika na tuna mamlaka yetu. Tumeshapata ‘venders’ wetu tayari kwa kila kanda kwa hiyo kama kuna mtu mwingine atapata watu wake wengine aendelee na hao. “Tumesema tunataka kuunganishwa na TRA (Mamlaka ya Mapato Tanzania) kupunguza gharama hatutataka kuunganishwa kwa mtu mwingine akatutoze. Kama mlivyosikia chaji watu wamekwenda hadi asilimia 0.7,bado wanataka ipunguzwe kidogo ili tuweze kuanza kazi. Alisema wamekubaliana na watoa huduma hao kuwa ndani ya siku 45 kila kitu kitakuwa tayari ikiwamo kuingiza mashine za kukatishia tiketi (POS) pamoja na kutoa mafunzo. Alisema bei ya POS, itakuwa Sh 250,000 ambazo zinaweza kutolewa kwa kukopeshwa  mmiliki kulipia kidogo kidogo, kukodisha au kununua kwa fedha taslimu na kwamba wameamua kufanya hivyo ili taifa lisikie wameshatoka hatua moja kwenda nyingine. “Tusingetaka tusikie kwamba tunasukumwa au tunalazimishwa hatua tuliyofikia ni nzuri hatutaki tena turumbane na serikali, Jumatatu tunafanya makubaliano ya mwisho kisha tunaingia kwenye mikataba yetu na kuendelea na kazi. Kuhusu kuwapo taarifa kuwa kesho Latra wanamtangaza mtoa huduma mwingine kwaajili ya kuendesha mfumo wa kukatisha tiketi hizo alisema kuwa wanachotambua ni kwamba Latra ni mdhibiti wa Usafiri na hata katika kanuni zake hakuna mahala inawabana wao wafanye kazi na mtu Fulani. “Wamiliki tuko huru kuchagua mfumo, tunayo barua ya TRA (Mamlaka ya Mapato Tanzania), inayotutaka tupeleke watu wenye mfumo, sasa huyo atakayetukatalia kwamba sisi lazima tuingie huko alikotangaza hao waliobaki nje ya mfumo ambao si wanachama wetu wana uhuru wa kujiunga popote, lakini sisi tayari tumeshapata mfumo wetu hatutaki kujiunga na mtu yeyote. Kuhusu usalama wa fedha zao wamesema kuwa suala hilo litaingizwa kwenye mkataba na kwamba moja ya masharti ni lazima mkandarasi anayepewa kazi hiyo awe na uwezo wa kifedha ili ikitokea amepoteza fedha zao awe na uwezo wa kuzilipa. Alisema  katika makubaliano yao watoa huduma hao watagawanywa katika kanda tano ambazo ni pamoja na Kusini, Nyanda za Juu Kusini, Kaskazini, Kanda ya Ziwa na kanda ya Kati Alisema  licha ya Juni 30, mwaka jana, Waziri Mkuu Kassim Majaliwa  kuagiza TRA ikae na chama hicho ili kushughulikia suala hilo haijaweza kufanya hivyo badala yake wamekuwa wakilaumiwa kuwa hawataki kutumia tiketi za kielektroniki. Kuhusu mfumo wa kufuatilia mwenendo wa mabasi (VTS) alisema umeendelea kuwavuruga  na kwamba wanachama wameamua kuwa kwa kuwa Waziri Mkuu ndiye aliyesitisha tozo zilizokuwa zinatozwa na kambuni zilizokuwa zinafunga mifumo hiyo, wanataka wapate barua kutoka ofisi ya Waziri Mkuu ili wajue kama gharama hiyo imeshuka ili waweze kuendeelea kufunga na kulipia. Kuhusu baadhi ya kanuni za sheria ya Latra ambazo hazitekelezeki ikiwamo kumtaka mmiliki wa basi kuweza alama kwenye mzigo yote inayobebwa kwenye basi alisema kuwa wameazimia kutumia njia tatu kumaliza suala hilo ikiwamo kuandika barua kwenda katika mamlaka husika, kutumia njia za kisiasa na ikishindikana wasitishe kutoa huduma.","LEONARD MANG'OHADAR ES SALAAM Tanzania Bus Owners Association (TABOA), has said that it has reached good steps to start using the electronic ticket booking system as ordered by the Government. Giving the resolutions of the party's general meeting held in Dar es Salaam the other day, the General Secretary of Taboa, Enea Mrutu, mentioned some of the steps taken to start using the system including finding five companies that will provide services in five regions. He said today they are expected to sit with the service providers to discuss the price they will charge due to the members claiming a cost of 0.7 percent, which is still high and after that the service providers will go to the regions to provide education to the users of the system. ""We do not need to be brought in by someone, we are an independent institution that is respected and we have our authority. We have already found our 'vendors' for each region, so if there is someone else who will find his other people, he should continue with them. ""We have said that we want to be connected with TRA (Tanzania Revenue Authority) to reduce costs, we will not want to be connected to someone else who will charge us. As you have heard, people's charges have gone up to 0.7 percent, they still want it to be reduced a little so that we can start work. He said they have agreed with the service providers that within 45 days everything will be ready, including installing ticketing machines (POS) as well as providing training. He said the price of the POS will be Shs 250,000 which can be loaned to the owner to pay little by little, rent or buy in cash and that they have decided to do so so that the nation can hear that they have gone from one step to another. ""We would not want to hear that we are being pushed or forced, the step we reached is good, we no longer want to fight with the government, on Monday we make the final agreement and then we enter into our contracts and continue with work. Regarding the information that tomorrow Latra is announcing another service provider to operate the ticketing system, he said that what they realize is that Latra is the regulator of Transportation and even in its regulations there is no place where it forces them to work with a certain person. ""Owners are free to choose the system, we have a letter from the TRA (Tanzania Revenue Authority), which wants us to send people with the system, now whoever refuses us that we must enter where he announced that those who remained outside the system who are not our members are free to join anywhere, but we we already have our system we don't want to join anyone. Regarding the security of their money, they have said that the issue will be included in the contract and that one of the conditions is that the contractor who is given the job must have financial capacity so that if he loses his money, he will be able to pay it. He said that in their agreement the service providers will be divided into five zones which include the South, the Southern Highlands, the North, the Lake Zone and the Central Zone. He said despite June 30, last year, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa ordered TRA to stay with the party to address the issue has not been able to do so instead they have been blamed for not wanting to use electronic tickets. Regarding the bus monitoring system (VTS) he said that it has continued to disturb them and that the members have decided that since the Prime Minister stopped the charges that were being charged by the companies that were closing the systems, they want to get a letter from the Prime Minister's office to know if the cost has dropped so that they can proceed to install and pay. Regarding some of the rules of the Latra law that are not being implemented, including requiring the bus owner to mark all the luggage carried on the bus, he said that they are determined to use three methods to end the issue, including writing a letter to the relevant authorities, using political methods and if that fails, stop providing the service."

Wakizungumza mara baada ya kujiunga na CCM Singibala amesema kilichowasukuma kujiunga na CCM ni utendaji kazi mzuri wa Rais John Magufuli wa kuwaletea wananchi maendeleo. Singibala amesema wakati akiwa Chadema kama kiongozi alikuwa na shauku ya kutaka kusifia baadhi ya kazi nzuri za maendeleo zinazofanywa na Rais Magufuli lakini alishindwa kutokana na chama hicho kumkataza kufanya hivyo. “Kuna kazi nzuri ambazo zimefanywa hapa Bariadi, nilitaka kumpongeza Rais Magufuli na viongozi wengine, lakini ukiwa Chadema ni marufuku kufanya hivyo hata kama ni kweli, ukiwa huko hakuna demokrasia, hakuna uhuru, wanataka kila kitu upinge hata kama ni kweli. “Niliwaambia mtu akifanya vizuri tumpe haki yake, lakini wapi waligoma, kule hilo jambo la kupongeza halipo, niliona kwa nini niendelee kutesa moyo wangu, nikaona ni vyema kufanya maamuzi haya kujiunga CCM,” amesema Singibala.

The leaders were received today Sunday May 31 by members of the CCM Bariadi District led by their Chairman Juliana Mahongo and the Head of the District Festo Kiswaga. Speaking immediately after joining CCM, Singibala said what pushed them to join CCM was the good work of President John Magufuli to bring development to the people. Singibala has said that when he was Chadema as a leader, he was eager to praise some of the good development works being done by President Magufuli, but he failed due to the party prohibiting him from doing so. ""There are good works that have been done here in Bariadi, I wanted to congratulate President Magufuli and other leaders, but when you are Chadema it is forbidden to do that even if it is true, when you are there there is no democracy, there is no freedom, they want you to oppose everything even if it is true.

Walininipatia huduma na saa 12.00 walinihamishia  Hospitali ya Taifa Muhimbili (MNH). “Nilipokelewa pale ‘emergence’, baadaye nikahamishiwa  JKCI.  Waliponipima waligundua ‘pressure’ yangu ipo juu… kazi zetu zina msongo wa mawazo mengi ndiyo maana ilipanda ghafla,” alisema. Aliwashukuru madaktari wote waliomhudumia na kuwakumbusha watanzania kupima afya zao mara kwa mara. “Nawahimiza pia kukata bima ya afya maana ndiyo iliyoweza kunisaidia kupata huduma bora na wao waone umuhimu huo,” alisisitiza. Mkurugenzi wa JKCI, Profesa Mohamed Janabi alisema bado wanaendelea kuchunguza afya ya mbunge huyo kujua tatizo gani hasa lililosababisha  shinikizo  la damu kuwa juu. “Taasisi yetu inatibu watu wanaougua magonjwa ya moyo, siwezi kusema moja kwa moja iwapo Zungu ana tatizo la moyo, tunachunguza kujua sababu za shinikizo lake kupanda,” alisema. Alisema wana imani kwamba hadi kufikia wiki ijayo watamruhusu kurejea nyumbani kuendelea na shughuli zake za kila siku. “Nasema hivi kwa sababu hali aliyokuja nayo ni tofauti na alivyo sasa, hadi nyie (waandishi) ameweza kuzungumza  nanyi. “Jambo ambalo Watanzania wanapaswa kutambua mtu yeyote aliyeanzishiwa dozi ya matatizo haya ya ‘pressure’ anapaswa kuzitumia katika kipindi chote cha maisha yake hapa duniani. “Tunapata wagonjwa wengi ambao tuliwagundua kuwa na tatizo hili walipoanza dawa na kuona wanaendelea vizuri wakaacha leo hii wanarudi wakiwa wagonjwa zaidi, wakumbuke kuacha kutumia dawa ni makosa makubwa,” alisema.","BY VERONICA ROMWALD – DAR ES SALAAM Member of Parliament for Ilala, Mussa Zungu (CCM), has been admitted to the Jakaya Kikwete Cardiovascular Institute (JKCI) for treatment after developing a blood pressure problem. Zungu was brought to the hospital the other day in the evening from Amana Hospital where he received initial treatment. Speaking to journalists yesterday, Zungu said he is thanking God now that his condition is going well. ""My condition was bad, I started feeling bad at 8:30 in the afternoon the other day when I was at home, so they had to take Amana to me. They provided me with care and at 12.00 they transferred me to Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH). ""When I was received at 'emergency', later I was transferred to JKCI. When they tested me, they found out that my 'pressure' is high... our work has a lot of stress, that's why it suddenly increased,"" he said. He thanked all the doctors who treated him and reminded Tanzanians to check their health regularly. ""I also encourage them to cut the health insurance because it is what helped me get better care and they see the importance,"" he emphasized. Director of JKCI, Professor Mohamed Janabi said they are still investigating the MP's health to find out what exactly caused the high blood pressure. ""Our institute treats people suffering from heart diseases, I cannot directly say if Zungu has a heart problem, we are investigating to find out the reasons for his high blood pressure,"" he said. He said they are confident that by next week they will allow him to return home to continue his daily activities. ""I say this because the situation he came with is different from what he is now, until you (writers) have been able to talk to you. ""What Tanzanians should realize is that anyone who has been given a dose of these 'pressure' problems should use them throughout his life on earth. ""We find many patients who we discovered had this problem when they started taking medicine and saw that they were doing well, then they stopped today and they come back even sicker, remember that stopping taking medicine is a big mistake,"" he said."
" NAIROBI, KENYA SIKU moja tu baada ya mwili wa Kaimu Mkurugenzi wa Teknohama wa Tume Huru ya Uchaguzi na Mipaka (IEBC), Chris Msando kupatikana akiwa amefariki dunia baada ya awali kutoweka, Msemaji wa Jeshi la Ulinzi la Kenya (KDF), Kanali Joseph Owuoth, amejitokeza na kuzishangaa ripoti zinazodai naye ametoweka. Kanali Owuoth amesema yeye ni mzima wa afya na anaendelea na majukumu yake. Alisema kuwa hayuko Kisumu kama inavyodaiwa na kwamba taarifa hizo za uzushi zipuuzwe. “Ni mzima na sielewi zinakotoka ripoti hizi,” alisema. Kauli yake imekuja saa chache baada ya familia yake kudai kuwa imeshindwa kumpata. Familia pia ilidai Kanali Owuoth alipewa likizo ya lazima kupisha uchunguzi kuhusu nyaraka za siri za jeshi zilizochapishwa na upinzani wiki iliyopita. Taarifa hizo zinakuja siku moja tu baada ya kundi la wanasiasa wa upinzani, National Super Alliance (Nasa) kuitisha mkutano wa wanahabari kudai kuwa Kanali Owuoth amesimamishwa. “Amepewa likizo ya lazima na kuamriwa kurudi nyumbani kwake Kijiji cha Koru,” alidai Seneta wa Kisumu, Anyang’ Nyong’o katika mkutano na wanahabari mjini humo. Nyong’o, ambaye kwa sasa anawania ugavana wa Kisumu, alidai kuwa Kanali Owuoth alikuwa akiwasiliana mara kwa mara na dada yake Elizabeth hadi jana (juzi) wakati alipokuwa Nakuru, lakini sasa familia haimpati. Hata hivyo, pamaja na ripoti hizo, simu yake ilikuwa hewani sawa na akaunti yake ya WhatsApp ijapokuwa ujumbe aliokuwa akitumiwa haukuwa ukijibiwa. Kanali Owuoth alijiingiza katikati ya utata baada ya vinara wa Nasa kuanika nyaraka zinazolituhumu jeshi kupanga njama za kukisaidia Chama cha Jubilee kubaki madarakani kwa lazima. Operesheni hiyo, kwa mujibu wa nyaraka ni pamoja na kukata umeme na usambazaji wa maji katika baadhi ya maeneo, kuandikisha askari wapya wa kudhibiti umati, kuweka makamanda rafiki wa Jubilee na mengineyo ambayo upinzani ulisema utawafanya wafuasi wake kutojitokeza kupiga kura. Kanali Owuoth badaye alithibitisha uhalisia wa nyaraka hizo, lakini aliwatuhumu wanasiasa kwa kupotosha maudhui ya operersheni hiyo kwa malengo ya kisiasa. Lakini baadaye Waziri wa Ulinzi, Raychelle Omamo, alizikana nyaraka hizo, akisema hajaziona na kuwa KDF haina njama zozote zilizo nje ya sheria.","NAIROBI, KENYA Just one day after the body of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Acting Director of Teknohama, Chris Msando was found dead after initially disappearing, Kenya Defense Force (KDF) Spokesman, Colonel Joseph Owuoth , has appeared and surprised the reports claiming that he has also disappeared. Colonel Owuoth has said that he is healthy and continues with his duties. He said that he is not in Kisumu as claimed and that the false information should be ignored. ""I am healthy and I do not understand where these reports are coming from,"" he said. His statement came a few hours after his family claimed that they had been unable to find him. The family also claimed that Colonel Owuoth was given mandatory leave to pass an investigation into secret military documents published by the opposition last week. The information comes just one day after a group of opposition politicians, the National Super Alliance (Nasa) called a press conference to claim that Colonel Owuoth has been suspended. ""He has been given compulsory leave and ordered to return to his home in Koru Village,"" claimed Kisumu Senator Anyang' Nyong'o in a press conference in the town. Nyong'o, who is currently running for the governorship of Kisumu, claimed that Colonel Owuoth was in regular contact with his sister Elizabeth until yesterday (the other day) when he was in Nakuru, but now the family cannot find him. However, according to the reports, his phone was in the air as well as his WhatsApp account even though the messages he was sending were not being answered. Colonel Owuoth found himself in the middle of controversy after Nasa leaders released documents accusing the military of conspiring to help the Jubilee Party remain in power. The operation, according to the documents, includes cutting off electricity and water supply in some areas, recruiting new crowd control soldiers, placing friendly commanders of Jubilee and other things that the opposition said would make its supporters not turn up to vote. Colonel Owuoth later confirmed the authenticity of the documents, but accused politicians of distorting the content of the operation for political purposes. But later the Minister of Defense, Raychelle Omamo, denied the documents, saying he had not seen them and that the KDF does not have any illegal plots."
"OREGON, MAREKANI KAMPUNI ya utengenezaji vifaa vya michezo ya Nike imesitisha mkataba na uhusiano na bondia Manny Pacquiao, baada ya nyota huyo wa uzito wa juu duniani kuwashambulia wapenzi wa jinsia moja. Bingwa huyo wa masumbwi ulimwenguni mwenye umri wa miaka 37, ambaye anagombea nafasi ya useneta katika bunge nchini Ufilipino, mwanzoni mwa wiki hii alisema kwamba ‘watu wanaojihusisha na mapenzi ya jinsia moja ni wabaya kuliko wanyama’. Kutokana na hali hiyo, kampuni ya NIKE imetoa tamko lake kwa kusema kuwa kauli ya bondia huyo ina ufinyu wa mawazo. Katika tamko hilo, Nike inapinga ubaguzi wa aina yoyote ile na kwamba kampuni hiyo imejiwekea historia ya kuwaunga mkono na kutetea misimamo yake dhidi ya haki ya jamii ya wapenzi wa jinsia moja. Kampuni hiyo inayojishughulisha na vifaa vya michezo imethibitisha kuvunja mkataba na uhusiano na bondia huyo. Kauli hiyo ya Pacquiao aliitoa wakati alipokuwa akifanyiwa mahojiano kwenye runinga ambako awali alionekana kutojutia kauli yake hiyo, lakini baadaye katika akaunti yake ya Instagram akaitetea kauli hiyo kwa kusema kwamba alikuwa akisema ukweli kwa mujibu wa kilichoandikwa kwenye vitabu vya dini. Hata hivyo, baadaye bondia huyo akaandika kwenye ukurasa wake wa Facebook kwamba alikuwa haishambulii jamii hiyo ya wapenzi wa jinsia moja. Pacquiao anatarajiwa kuingia ulingoni kumkabili Mmarekani Timothy Bradley Jr mjini Las Vegas, Aprili mwaka huu.","OREGON, USA Sports equipment manufacturing company Nike has terminated the contract and relationship with boxer Manny Pacquiao, after the heavyweight star in the world attacked homosexuals. The 37-year-old world boxing champion, who is running for senator in the Philippine parliament, earlier this week said that 'homosexuals are worse than animals'. Due to this situation, the NIKE company has issued its statement by saying that the statement of the boxer has a narrow mind. In the statement, Nike opposes discrimination of any kind and that the company has a history of supporting and defending its positions against the rights of the gay community. The company that deals with sports equipment has confirmed breaking the contract and relationship with the boxer. Pacquiao made that statement when he was being interviewed on television where he initially seemed not to regret his statement, but later on his Instagram account he defended the statement by saying that he was telling the truth according to what was written in the religious books. However, later the boxer wrote on his Facebook page that he was not attacking the gay community. Pacquiao is expected to enter the ring to face the American Timothy Bradley Jr in Las Vegas, April this year."

Tunaishukuru serikali kwa kuanzisha wakala huu ambao pamoja na kuwa na wataalam wachache lakini wanaweza kusimamia kazi hii, changamoto kubwa ipo kwenye bajeti ya kutekeleza miradi hii,”alisema.Alisema wilaya yake sio ya tambarare ina miinuko na mito mingi na barabara hazipitiki wakati wote.“Binafsi nimejaribu kufanya mikutano vijijini kero kubwa ni barabara kati ya vijiji na vijiji,kata na kata,barabara zimekatika,TARURA wanajitahidi lakini bajeti sio kubwa. Mfano mwaka 2018\2019 wanatengeneza km 36 tu kati ya km 512 zilizopo hapo ni sawa na asilimia saba,”aliongeza Dk Haule.Alitolea mfano manispaa, TARURA ina mtandao wa barabara km 472 lakini kwa mwaka wanatengeneza km 50 sawa na asilimia 10 ilhali wana eneo kubwa la kuhudumia lakini rasilimali zilizopo ni kidogo.Aliishauri serikali kuwaongezea walau wafike asilimia 50 ili kuwezesha hasa vijijini kufikika kwa urahisi na kusafirisha mazao yao ambayo bei imekuwa ikilalamikiwa kushuka kutokana na kutokuwa na usafiri wa uhakika na hivyo kuwa kikwazo katika kuendesha shughuli za kiuchumi za wananchi kikamilifu.“Barabara za TANROADS zinazopata asilimia 70 bado zina changamoto na nyingine hazipitiki, sasa kama asilimia 70 wanasuasua, je, asilimia 30 itakuwaje,”amehoji Dk Haule.Pamoja na ushauri huo alizungumzia changamoto ya mifugo na uharibifu wa mazingira unaopelekea uharibifu wa barabara na kuahidi kusimamia ili mifugo na uharibifu mwingine wa mazingira hautokei barabara zinazotumia fedha nyingi ziweze kudumu kipindi kirefu na kuleta matokeo tarajiwa.","The Chief of Sumbawanga District in Rukwa region, Dr. Khalfan Haule has asked the government to increase the Rural and Urban Roads Agency (TARURA) road fund from 30 to 50 percent. thus helping implement the Election Manifesto of Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM). Dr. Haule told the reporter of this newspaper the other day that TARURA serves many roads in rural areas which are in bad condition but the money allocated is less and it is unable to complete projects. ""The condition of the roads in general is not good . We thank the government for establishing this agency which despite having few experts but can manage this work, the big challenge is in the budget to implement these projects,"" he said. He said his district is not flat, it has hills and many rivers and the roads are impassable all the time. Personally, I have tried to hold meetings in villages, the biggest problem is the road between villages and villages, ward and ward, the roads are broken, TARURA is working hard but the budget is not big. For example, in 2018/2019, they are building only 36 km out of the 512 km that are there, equal to seven percent,"" added Dr. Haule. He gave the example of the municipality, TARURA has a road network of 472 km, but in a year, they are building 50 km, equal to 10 percent, even though they have an area large to serve but the available resources are few. He advised the government to increase them at least to 50 percent to enable especially rural areas to be easily accessible and to transport their products, the price of which has been complained of falling due to the lack of reliable transportation and thus becoming an obstacle in running the economic activities of the people fully. ""TANROADS roads that have 70 percent still have challenges and others are impassable, now if 70 percent are in trouble, what will happen to the 30 percent,"" asked Dr. Haule. Along with that advice, he talked about the challenge of livestock and the destruction of the environment that leads to the destruction of roads and promise to manage so that livestock and other environmental damage do not occur on the roads that use your money that can last for a long period of time and bring the expected results."

" LICHA ya dunia kuadhimisha Siku ya Saratani Februari 4, mwaka huu, imebainika kuwa bado ugonjwa huo ni tishio zaidi duniani.Hata hivyo, nchi wanachama wa Jumuiya ya Afrika Mashariki (EAC) zimeonekana kuwa mstari wa mbele katika kukabiliana na ugonjwa huo, kwa kuanzisha kampeni mbalimbali ikiwemo ujenzi wa hospitali za kisasa karibu katika kila nchi mwanachama.Kwa mujibu wa Wakala wa Kimataifa wa Utafiti wa Saratani, takribani wagonjwa wapya takribani milioni 22 wanatarajiwa kubainika kila mwaka ifikapo mwaka 2030, ikilinganishwa na milioni 14 waliobainika kuanzia mwaka 2012, huku vifo vikitarajiwa kuongezeka kutoka milioni 8.2 hadi milioni 13 ifikapo mwaka 2030. Na katika kukabiliana na ugonjwa huo, Rwanda hivi karibuni iliungana na nchi nyingine za EAC kuzindua kituo chake cha kisasa cha tiba ya kansa kinachomilikiwa na Hospitali ya Jeshi la Rwanda.Pia imelenga kutumia dola milioni 3.4 kwa mafunzo ya madaktari bingwa wa kansa 21, wataalamu wa mionzi, ngozi, wauguzi na kadhalika. Hii inamaanisha kuwa, nchi za EAC zimedhamiria kukabiliana kwa vitendo na ugonjwa huo ambao umekuwa ukigharimu fedha nyingi kwa kupeleka wagonjwa nje ya nchi. Rwanda kwa mfano, ugonjwa wa kwanda umetajwa kusababisha vifo 5,000 kila mwaka, sawa na asilimia 7 ya vifo vyote, kwa mujibu wa Shirika la Afya Duniani (WHO).Kwa mujibu wa Waziri wa Afya nchini Rwanda, Dk Diana Gashumba, mbali ya hospitali ya kisasa, pia wana mikakati thabiti ya kuongeza ubora wa huduma katika vituo vya afya ili kukabiliana na saratani na magonjwa mengine yasiyoambukiza. “Mbali ya kutibu wagonjwa wa Rwanda, milango iko wazi kwa wagonjwa wengine kutoka nchi jirani,” alisema Luteni Kanali Pacifique Mugenzi, Mkurugenzi Mkuu wa Hospitali hiyo inayolenga kutoa huduma kwa mfumo wa bima za afya kwa takribani asilimia 80 ya wagonjwa watakaotibiwa hospitalini hapo.Wagonjwa wengiKatika ukanda wa EAC, Kenya ndiyo inayotajwa kuwa na idadi kubwa ya vifo kwa mwaka, kiasi cha 33,000 zikiwa ni takwimu kutoka WHO.Kenya iliripotiwa kuwa na wagonjwa 47,887 wa saratani mwaka 2018, wa saratani ya matiti wakiwa asilimia 13, kansa ya kizazi asilimia 11 na waliogua saratani ya koo wakiwa asilimia 9. Kulikuwa na vifo 15,762 mwaka 2016 na viliongezeka na kufikia 16,953 mwaka 2017.Na katika kukabiliana na kasi ya ugonjwa huo, Kenya imepanga kuwa kitovu cha tiba ya saratani katika Jumuiya ya Afrika Mashariki (EAC) na tayari imeanza mikakati ya kuanza na vituo vikubwa vinane vitakavyotoa matibabu ya kina ya ugonjwa huo. Pia katika mpango wake wa miaka mitano, Kenya inakusudia kusambaza tiba ya saratani katika Kaunti zake 47. Waziri wa Afya, Sicily Kariuki alikaririwa akisema mpango huo unatarajiwa kuanza haraka, lengo likiwa si kuwahudumia Wakenya kwa kiwango cha hali ya juu tu, bali wakazi wa nchi zote za Jumuiya ya Afrika Mashariki.“Tunaamini licha ya kujali afya za wakazi wetu, kwa tiba hii tutavutia wageni kutoka nje ya jumuiya watakaokuja kutibiwa. Huo ndio mtazamo wetu wa mbali,” alisema. Chini ya Mpango wa Taifa wa Udhibiti Saratani, wizara inakusudia kuziwezesha hospitali za kaunti zote kwa huduma za upasuaji, mionzi na tiba mbalimbali kwa ajili ya wagonjwa wanaolazwa na wanaotibiwa na kuondoka. Mpango huo unakwenda sambamba na kuanzisha kwa vituo vikubwa vya tiba ya saratani Mombasa, Nakuru, Nyeri na Kisii ili kuzipunguzia mzigo Hospitali ya Taifa ya Kenyatta (KNH) na Hospitali ya Rufaa ya Tiba ya Afya ya Moi.TanzaniaWakati Kenya ikiwa ya kwanza kwa idadi kubwa ya wagonjwa na vifo vitokanavyo na satani, Tanzania imetajwa kuwa ya pili kwa vifo 28,000 kwa mwaka, ikifuatiwa na Uganda yenye vifo 21,000 kwa mwaka. Takwimu za Taasisi ya Saratani ya Ocean Road ya Dar es Salaam, zinaonesha kuwa kwa ujumla kumekuwa na ongezeko la wagonjwa wa saratani.Mwaka 2015 kulikuwa na wagonjwa wapya 5,764 na mwaka 2016 waligundulika wagonjwa 6,338, idadi iliyoendelea kukua na kufikia 7,091 mwaka 2017 na mwaka jana wagonjwa 7,649. Hata hivyo, aina ya saratani inayotajwa kusababisha vifo zaidi ni ya kizazi inayochangia asilimia 31.2 ya vifo, ikifuatiwa na saratani ya matiti (asilimia 12), saratani ya koo (asilimia 9.8), tezi dume 3.9, saratani ya sehemu ya kichwa na shingo (asilimia 6.8), kansa ya kibofu cha mkojo (asilimia 2.8) na saratani ya ngozi, asilimia 2.6. Aprili mwaka jana, Tanzania lilikuwa taifa la saba Afrika kuanzishwa chanjo ya shingo ya kizazi ambayo husababisha vifo vya wanawake wengi kwa mwaka.Waziri wa Afya wa Tanzania, Ummy Mwalimu alisema Desemba mwaka jana kuwa, katika kila wagonjwa 100 wa kansa, 34 huugua saratani ya mlango wa kizazi na 12 kansa ya matiti. Na katika kukabiliana zaidi ya ugonjwa huo, Serikali ya Tanzania mwaka jana ilitoa Sh bilioni 7 ili kuiongezea uwezo wa kutibu Taasisi ya Saratani Ocean Road (ORCI). Dk Crispin Kahesa, Mkurugenzi wa Kitengo cha Tiba katika ORCI, alikaririwa akisema kuwa gharama cha tiba ya saratani zimepanda kutoka Sh milioni 400 mwaka jana hadi Sh bilioni 9 kwa sasa.Aliongeza kuwa, ugonjwa huo ni changamoto kubwa katika sekta ya afya Tanzania. ORCI inapokea takribani wagonjwa 50,000 kwa mwaka, huku 29,000 wakitajwa kupoteza maisha.UgandaNchini Uganda, wagonjwa 32,617 waligundulika kuwa na saratani mwaka 2018, ikilinganishwa na 5,000 mwaka 5,000 na 4,000 mwaka 2016. Kati ya wagonjwa hao wa mwaka 2018, wagonjwa 21,829 waliaga dunia.Hayo ni kwa mujibu wa Waziri wa Nchi anayeshughulikia Afya ya Msingi, Joyce Aducu na kuonesha kuguswa na takwimu za Taasisi ya Saratani Uganda (UCI). Alisema wagonjwa wengi hujitokeza wakati kuchunguzwa wakati tayari ugonjwa ukiwa umeshasambaa mwilini, hivyo kufanya kazi ya kutibu kuwa ngumu. Machi mwaka 2017, Uganda iliteuliwa na nchi wanachama wa EAC kuwa na hospitali ya kisasa ya magonjwa ya kansa iliyotengewa Dola za Marekani milioni 34 kwa ajili ya kuhudumia nchi wanachama. EAC inaundwa na nchi sita ambazo ni Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi na Sudan Kusini.Kauli ya EACKutokana na wimbi la ongezeko la wagonjwa kwenda kutibiwa nje ya nchi, uongozi wa EAC kupitia Katibu Mtendaji wa Tume ya Utafiti wa Afya ya Afrika Mashariki (EAHRC), Profesa Gibson Kibiki, ulielezea kusikitishwa na idadi kubwa ya wananchi ndani ya jumuiya kukimbilia tiba nje ya nchi, akisema kuna tiba bora na nafuu katika hospitali zilizopo ndani ya jumuiya kwa sasa.Alisema baadhi ya huduma zinazofuatwa nje kama tiba ya saratani, figo, moyo na kadhalika, sasa zinapatikana ndani ya Afrika Mashariki. Alisema kwa wagonjwa wenye matatizo ya figo wanaweza kutibiwa Kenya ambako huduma hiyo inatolewa kwa viwango vya juu; wenye magonjwa ya moyo wanaweza kutibiwa kwenye Taasisi ya Jakaya Kikwete (JKCI) iliyopo Muhimbili, Dar es Salaam nchini Tanzania, ambayo inatoa matibabu ya kibingwa kiasi cha kuwa gumzo ndani na nje ya jumuiya.","ALTHOUGH the world celebrates Cancer Day on February 4, this year, it has been found that the disease is still the biggest threat in the world. However, the member countries of the East African Community (EAC) have been seen to be at the forefront in dealing with the disease, by starting a campaign including the construction of modern hospitals in almost every member country. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, about 22 million new patients are expected to be diagnosed every year by 2030, compared to 14 million who were diagnosed from 2012, while deaths are expected increasing from 8.2 million to 13 million by 2030. And in response to the disease, Rwanda recently joined other EAC countries to launch its modern cancer treatment center owned by the Rwanda Army Hospital. It has also aimed to spend 3.4 million dollars for the training of 21 oncologists, radiologists, dermatologists, nurses and so on. This means that the EAC countries are determined to deal effectively with the disease which has been costing a lot of money by sending patients abroad. In Rwanda, for example, measles is said to cause 5,000 deaths every year, equal to 7 percent of all deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the Minister of Health in Rwanda, Dr. Diana Gashumba, apart from the hospital modern, they also have solid strategies to increase the quality of services in health centers to deal with cancer and other non-communicable diseases. ""Apart from treating Rwandan patients, the doors are open to other patients from neighboring countries,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Pacifique Mugenzi, Director General of the hospital which aims to provide services through the health insurance system for approximately 80 percent of the patients who will be treated at the hospital. Many In the EAC region, Kenya is said to have the highest number of deaths per year, with 33,000 being statistics from WHO. Kenya was reported to have 47,887 cancer patients in 2018, breast cancer being 13 percent, cervical cancer 11 percent and those who suffered from throat cancer were 9 percent. There were 15,762 deaths in 2016 and they increased to 16,953 in 2017. And in response to the speed of the disease, Kenya has planned to become the center of cancer treatment in the East African Community (EAC) and already has begun strategies to start with eight large centers that will provide comprehensive treatment of the disease. Also in its five-year plan, Kenya intends to distribute cancer treatment in its 47 counties. The Minister of Health, Sicily Kariuki was quoted as saying that the plan is expected to start quickly, with the aim not only to serve Kenyans at a high level, but the country's residents all of the East African Community. ""We believe that despite caring for the health of our residents, with this treatment we will attract visitors from outside the community who will come to be treated. That is our distant view,"" he said. Under the National Cancer Control Plan, the ministry intends to empower hospitals in all counties with surgical services, radiation and various treatments for patients admitted and treated and discharged. The plan goes hand in hand with the establishment of large cancer treatment centers in Mombasa, Nakuru, Nyeri and Kisii to reduce the burden on the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) and the Moi Health Referral Hospital. Tanzania While Kenya is the first with a large number of patients and deaths from satan, Tanzania is named second with 28,000 deaths per year, followed by Uganda with 21,000 deaths per year. Data from the Ocean Road Cancer Institute of Dar es Salaam, show that there has been an increase in cancer patients in general. In 2015 there were 5,764 new patients and in 2016 6,338 patients were diagnosed, the number continued to grow and reached 7,091 in 2017 and last year 7,649 patients. However, the type of cancer that causes the most deaths is cervical which accounts for 31.2 percent of deaths, followed by breast cancer (12 percent), throat cancer (9.8 percent), prostate 3.9 percent, head and neck cancer (percent 6.8), bladder cancer (2.8 percent) and skin cancer, 2.6 percent. In April last year, Tanzania became the seventh country in Africa to introduce cervical vaccination, which causes the death of many women a year. Tanzania's Minister of Health, Ummy Mwalimu said last December that, in every 100 cancer patients, 34 suffer from cervical cancer. cervix and 12 breast cancer. And in response to the disease, the Government of Tanzania last year provided Sh7 billion to increase the capacity to treat the Ocean Road Cancer Institute (ORCI). Dr. Crispin Kahesa, Director of the Medical Unit at ORCI, was quoted as saying that the cost of cancer treatment has risen from Shs 400 million last year to Shs 9 billion at present. He added that the disease is a major challenge in the health sector in Tanzania. ORCI receives approximately 50,000 patients per year, with 29,000 deaths. Uganda In Uganda, 32,617 patients were diagnosed with cancer in 2018, compared to 5,000 in 2016, 5,000 and 4,000 in 2016. Among those patients in 2018, 21,829 patients died. it is according to the Minister of State for Primary Health, Joyce Aducu and showed reaction to the statistics of the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI). He said many patients show up for examination when the disease has already spread throughout the body, thus making the task of treating it difficult. In March 2017, Uganda was nominated by the EAC member countries to have a modern cancer hospital allocated US$ 34 million to serve the member countries. The EAC is made up of six countries which are Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan. Statement of the EAC Due to the increasing wave of patients going to be treated abroad, the leadership of the EAC through the Executive Secretary of the East African Health Research Commission (EAHRC), Professor Gibson Kibiki, expressed dismay at the large number of people in the community resorting to treatment abroad, saying that there is better and cheaper treatment in hospitals in the community at the moment. He said some of the services that are followed abroad such as cancer treatment kidney, heart and so on, are now found in East Africa. He said that patients with kidney problems can be treated in Kenya where the service is provided at high levels; those with heart disease can be treated at the Jakaya Kikwete Institute (JKCI) located in Muhimbili, Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, which provides expert treatment to the point of being a buzz inside and outside the community."
"KINSHASA,    DRC  MSHINDI  wa  pili wa urais katika uchaguzi mkuu   nchini
hapa, Martin Fayulu, juzi aliwasilisha rasmi  pingamizi katika Mahakama ya Katiba kuyakataa
matokeo ya uchaguzi akisema   yalighubikwa na udanganyifu. Fayulu alisema  matokeo
ya uchaguzi wa Desemba 30 yaliyotangazwa na Tume ya Taifa ya Uchaguzi, CENI,
yalikuwa yamepangwa na ametoa wito kura zihesabiwa upya.    Mahakama ya Katiba ina
siku saba za kuisikiliza rufaa hiyo.   Fayulu anayapinga matokeo ya uchaguzi wa
Desemba 30 mwaka jana  yaliyompa ushindi
Felix Tshisekedi ambaye  pia ni kutoka
upande wa upinzani. Alisema  Tshisekedi alishinda
uchaguzi huo kutokana na mpango wa siri uliofikiwa kati yake na Rais
anayeondoka madarakani, Joseph Kabila. Muungano wa vyama vya upinzani unaoongozwa na Fayulu na
unaojulikana kama Lamuka, unadai   kiongozi wao alishinda uchaguzi huo kwa
asilimia 61, hiyo ikiwa ni kulingana na waangalizi 40,000 wa uchaguzi kutoka
Kanisa Katoliki.  CENI ilisema  Fayulu
alipata asilimia 34 ya kura zilizohesabiwa  huku Tshisekedi akishinda kwa kupata asilimia
38. Fayulu aliwaambia waandishi habari kwamba miongoni mwa mambo
anayotaka ni pamoja na kubandikwa  karatasi
za matokeo nje ya vituo vya kupigia kura. Toussaint Ekombe,   wakili wa Fayulu alisema kiongozi huyo
anataka yafutwe matokeo ya awali yaliyotangazwa na CENI  na kumpa Tshisekedi ushindi.  Akizungumza juzi  na
waandishi habari nje ya mahakama hiyo, Ekombe alisema rufaa hiyo iliwasilishwa  Ijumaa. Fayulu alisema anaamini   Mwenyekiti wa CENI, Corneille Nangaa alikiuka
sheria ya uchaguzi wa Desemba 30 mwaka jana katika kumchagua mrithi wa Rais
Kabila.  Hata hivyo, Nangaa alisema kuna njia mbili tu za kuzichukua
hivi sasa: moja ni kuyakubali matokeo rasmi ya uchaguzi au kufutwa  uchaguzi huo na kuendelea kumuweka madarakani
Rais Kabila hadi uchaguzi mwingine utakapofanyika. ”Wananiita mimi ni askari wa watu na sitowaangusha watu
wangu,” alisema Fayulu. Alisema kuwa pingamizi aliloliwasilisha mahakamani
linajumuisha ushahidi kutoka kwa mashahidi waliokuwapo kwenye vituo vya kupigia
kura. Katika hatua nyingine,  vikosi vya usalama nchini hapa  viliyazingira makazi ya Fayulu  na kwenye mahakama alikokuwa akitarajiwa
kwenda kuwasilisha pingamizi la kuyakataa matokeo ya uchaguzi huo.  Watu walioshuhudia
walisema   wanajeshi na polisi waliyazingira maeneo hayo  kabla Fayulu hajawasilisha pingamizi lake
mahakamani. Wafuasi kadhaa wa Fayulu waliokusanyika nje ya hoteli yake  mjini hapa 
pamoja na makazi yake, walikuwa wakiimba nyimbo za kumpinga Rais Kabila
pamoja na Rais mteule, Tshisekedi, huku wakihisi kwamba kuzingirwa kwa maeneo
hayo ni jaribio la kumtisha Fayulu. Hayo yalitokea  wakati
muungano wa vyama vinavyoiunda serikali    inayoondoka madarakani umepata ushindi mkubwa
katika uchaguzi wa wabunge. Matokeo hayo yalitangazwa  juzi alfajiri na CENI.","KINSHASA, DRC WINNER of the second presidential election in the country
here, Martin Fayulu, the other day officially submitted an objection to the Constitutional Court to reject it
saying the election results were covered in fraud. Fayulu said the results
of the December 30 election announced by the National Election Commission, CENI,
had been arranged and he has called for the votes to be recounted. The Constitutional Court has
seven days to hear the appeal. Fayulu opposes the results of the election
December 30 last year which gave him victory
Felix Tshisekedi who is also from
the opposition side. He said Tshisekedi won
the election due to a secret plan reached between him and the President
who is leaving power, Joseph Kabila. The coalition of opposition parties led by Fayulu and
known as Lamuka, claims their leader won the election by
61 percent, that is according to 40,000 election observers from
Catholic Church. CENI said File
he got 34 percent of the votes counted while Tshisekedi won by getting a percentage
38. Fayulu told reporters that among the things
what he wants is to have a paper attached
of the results outside the polling stations. Toussaint Ekombe, Fayulu's lawyer said the leader
He wants to cancel the previous results announced by CENI and give Tshisekedi the victory. Talking the other day with
journalists outside the court, Ekombe said the appeal was filed on Friday. Fayulu said he believes the CENI Chairman, Corneille Nangaa violated it
the election law of December 30 last year in choosing the successor of the President
Tribe. However, Nangaa said there are only two ways to take them
right now: one is to accept the official results of the election or cancel the election and continue to put him in power
President Kabila until another election is held. ""They call me a soldier of the people and I will not let people down
mine,"" said Fayulu. He said that the objection he presented to the court
includes testimony from witnesses who were present at the polling stations
lot. In another step, security forces in this country surrounded Fayulu's residence and the court where he was expected
to submit an objection to reject the results of the election. People who witnessed
they said soldiers and police surrounded those areas before Fayulu presented his objection
in court. Several supporters of Fayulu gathered outside his hotel in the city here
along with his residence, they were singing songs against President Kabila
together with the President-elect, Tshisekedi, while feeling that the siege of the areas
that is an attempt to intimidate Fayulu. That happened when
the coalition of parties that make up the outgoing government has won a big victory
in parliamentary elections. The results were announced yesterday at dawn by CENI."
" NA KULWA MZEE-DAR ES SALAAM MKEMIA, Elias Mulima, amedai mahakamani kuwa mkojo wa mrembo wa zamani wa Tanzania (2006), Wema Sepetu ulibainika kuwa anavuta bangi, baada ya kufanyiwa uchunguzi. Mulima ambaye anatoka Ofisi ya Mkemia Mkuu wa Serikali, alidai hayo jana katika Mahakama ya Hakimu Mkazi Kisutu, Dar es Salaam alipokuwa akitoa ushahidi upande wa Jamhuri katika kesi ya kukutwa na msokoto wa bangi inayomkabili Wema na wenzake wawili. Shahidi huyo wa kwanza, akiongozwa na Wakili wa Serikali, Constantine Kakula alidai hayo mbele ya Hakimu Mkazi Mkuu,Thomas Simba. Alidai Februari 8, mwaka huu, alipokea sampuli ya mkojo wa Wema na Februari 6, alipokea majani ambayo alifanyia uchunguzi kujua kama yalikuwa dawa za kuleya au laa. “Wema aliletwa ofisini kwa Mkemia na Inspekta Willy na WP Mary, alipofika nilimfanyia usajili na kumpa namba ya maabara 321/2017. “Walimleta kwa sababu walitaka Wema apimwe mkojo na nilimpa kontena maalumu na kumpatia WP Mary ambaye aliongozana naye hadi kwenye vyoo, akatoa sampuli ya mkojo. “Baada ya kupatikana mkojo, nilipokea sampuli hiyo na kuendelea na uchunguzi ambapo hatua ya kwanza ni kuangalia chembechembe za dawa za kulevya  ndani ya mkojo wa Wema na baada ya uchunguzi nilibaini kuna dawa za kulevya aina ya bangi,”alidai. Mulima alidai, kiutaalamu bangi inaweza kuonekana kwenye mkojo  ndani ya siku 28. Alidai baada ya kuthibitisha anatumia bangi, aliandaa taarifa ya mchunguzi ambayo aliisaini yeye mwenyewe na ikathibitishwa na Kaimu Mkemia Mkuu wa Serikali, Februari 8, mwaka huu. Shahidi huyo ambaye ni msimamizi wa maabara, anafanya uchunguzi wa kitaalamu wa sampuli za dawa za kulevya, milipuko na sampuli zinazodhaniwa kuwa na sumu, aliendelea kudai  February 6, akiwa ofisini kwake alipokea kielelezo kutoka Jeshi la Polisi Tanzania kupitia kwa  D/Koplo Robert kikitakiwa kufanyiwa mchunguzi kuthibitisha ni dawa za kulevya aina ya bangi ama la. Alidai alikipokea kwa njia ya fomu DCEA 001, akakisajili na kukipa namba ya maabara 291/2017. Alidai alifungua na kukuta msokoto mmoja na vipisi viwili ndani yake na  majani yadhaniwayo kuwa ni bangi. “Niliyapima na kuyakuta yana uzito wa gramu 1.08, nilifanya uchunguzi kwa kutumia kemikali na kubaini ni bangi,”alidai. Shahidi alipotakiwa kuzitambua taarifa alizoandika kama zake, alidai anaweza kuzitambua kwa sababu ina saini yake, mhuri wa moto na namba ya maabara na akaomba kuitoa mahakamani kama kielelezo cha ushahidi. Wakili Peter Kibatala, anayemtete Wema, alipinga  ripoti hiyo isipokelewe  kwa sababu haijakidhi mahitaji ya kifungu cha 63 cha Sheria ya Mwenendo wa Mashauri ya Jinai (CPA) sura ya 20  iliyofanyiwa marekebisho mwaka 2002. Kibatala, alidai  kifungu hicho kinaeleza utaratibu wa kufanya mchunguzi wa kitabibu kwa mshtakiwa ambaye yupo chini ya ulinzi, kuwa  lazima polisi awasilishe maombi mahakamani. Kibatala, aliomba ripoti hiyo ikataliwe kwa sababu hakukuwa na ombi wala amri kutoka mahakamani. Pia alipinga ripoti hiyo kupokelewa kwa sababu haijaambatanishwa na fomu namba DCEA 001. Kutokana na hoja za Kibatala, Wakili Kakula alidai fomu  yenye namba 001 inatumiwa na  polisi wanapopeleka sampuli  na fomu namba 009 ni taarifa ya Mkemia na kwamba fomu moja, haitegemei nyingine kwa kuwa zinaandaliwa na watu tofauti. Kakula, alidai  sheria haijasema muda wote ni lazima maombi yapelekwe mahakamani amri itoke ndiyo mshtakiwa afanyiwe mchunguzi wa kitabibu, ila pale ambapo mshtakiwa hataki polisi wanaweza kufanya maombi mahakamani. Baada ya kusikiliza mabishano hayo ya kisheria, Hakimu Simba aliomba mahakama ipate nafasi ya kuzipitia nyaraka zinazobishaniwa, uamuzi utatolewa Agosti 4, mwaka huu. Washtakiwa wanakabiliwa na mashtaka mawili ya kukutwa na kiwango kidogo cha dawa za kulevya na kutumia dawa za kulevya. Inadaiwa Februari 4,2017 katika makazi ya Wema huko Kunduchi Ununio,washtakiwa walikutwa na msokoto mmoja na vipisi vya bangi vyenye uzito wa gramu 1.08. Kwa upande wa Wema, yeye anadaiwa Februari Mosi,mwaka huu katika  eneo lisilojulikana Dar es Salaam,  alitumia dawa za kulevya  aina ya bangi. Washtakiwa katika kesi hiyo, ni Wema na wenzake wawili ambao ni Angelina Msigwa na Matrida Seleman Abbas.","AND KULWA MZEE-DAR ES SALAAM A CHEMIST, Elias Mulima, has claimed in court that the urine of the former beauty queen of Tanzania (2006), Wema Sepetu, was found to smoke marijuana, after being examined. Mulima, who is from the Office of the Chief Government Chemist, claimed this yesterday in the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court, Dar es Salaam when he was testifying on the side of the Republic in the case of being found with a twist of cannabis facing Wema and his two colleagues. The first witness, led by the State Attorney, Constantine Kakula, claimed this before the Chief Resident Magistrate, Thomas Simba. He claimed on February 8, this year, he received a sample of Wema's urine and on February 6, he received leaves that he tested to see if they were birth control pills or not. ""Wema was brought to the chemist's office by Inspector Willy and WP Mary, when he arrived I registered him and gave him the laboratory number 321/2017. ""They brought him because they wanted Wema to be tested for urine and I gave him a special container and gave it to WP Mary who accompanied him to the toilets and gave a urine sample. ""After the urine was obtained, I received the sample and continued with the investigation where the first step is to check for drug particles in Wema's urine and after the investigation I found out that there are drugs in the form of cannabis,"" he claimed. Mulima claimed, technically cannabis can be seen in urine within 28 days. He claimed after confirming that he uses cannabis, he prepared an investigator's report which he signed himself and it was confirmed by the Acting Chief Chemist of the Government, on February 8, this year. The witness who is in charge of the laboratory, conducts professional examination of samples of drugs, explosives and samples that are thought to be toxic, he continued to claim on February 6, while in his office he received a specimen from the Tanzanian Police Force through D/Corporal Robert that it should be done the investigator to confirm whether or not the drug is marijuana. He claimed he received it through form DCEA 001, registered it and gave it the laboratory number 291/2017. He claimed he opened it and found one twist with two sticks inside and  leaves thought to be cannabis. ""I weighed them and found they weighed 1.08 grams, I did a test using chemicals and found out they were cannabis,"" he claimed. When the witness was asked to identify the information he had written as his own, he claimed he could identify it because it has his signature, fire stamp and laboratory number and he asked to produce it in court as evidence. Lawyer Peter Kibatala, who is defending Wema, objected to the report not being received because it does not meet the requirements of section 63 of the Criminal Procedure Act (CPA) chapter 20 which was amended in 2002. Kibatala claimed that the section describes the procedure for conducting a medical examination for the defendant who is in custody, the police must submit an application to the court. In vain, he requested that the report be rejected because there was no request or order from the court. He also objected to the report being received because it was not attached to form number DCEA 001. Due to Kibatala's arguments, Lawyer Kakula claimed that form number 001 is used by the police when they send samples and form number 009 is the Chemist's statement and that one form does not depend on the other as they are prepared and different people. Kakula, claimed that the law does not always say that applications must be sent to the court for an order to be issued for the accused to undergo a medical examination, but where the accused does not want the police can make applications to the court. After listening to the legal arguments, Judge Simba asked the court to have a chance to review the disputed documents, a decision will be made on August 4, this year. The defendants are facing two charges of possessing a small amount of drugs and using drugs. It is alleged that on February 4, 2017, at Wema's residence in Kunduchi Ununio, the defendants were found with one twist and cannabis seeds weighing 1.08 grams. On Wema's side, he is alleged to have used marijuana in February this year in an unknown area in Dar es Salaam. The defendants in the case are Wema and her two colleagues, Angelina Msigwa and Matrida Seleman Abbas."

" HATIMAYE Kampuni ya Acacia Mining plc na shughuli zake zote za uendeshaji imekuwa sehemu rasmi ya Kampuni ya Barrick Gold Corporation na sasa inamiliki hisa zote, ikiwa ni hatua ya kukubaliana na hoja za Serikali ya Rais John Magufuli kuhusu rasilimali za madini ziwanufaishe Watanzania.Hilo limewekwa bayana katika taarifa iliyotolewa jana Septemba 13, 2019 na Rais na Ofisa Mtendaji Mkuu wa Barrick Gold, Mark Bristow yenye makazi yake Toronto nchini Canada.Katika taarifa hiyo, Bristow alisema Barrick Gold Corporation imeamua kuinunua Acacia Mining plc ili kuwezesha kufikia mwafaka wa majadiliano kati ya kampuni hiyo na Serikali ya Tanzania katika kutatua mgogoro wa kibiashara uliokuwepo baina ya pande hizo mbili. Mapema Mei mwaka huu, Barrick iliwasilisha ombi la kununua hisa za asilimia 35 za Acacia ili kuwa na sauti moja katika kutatua mgogoro uliodumu kwa zaidi ya miaka miwili baina ya Acacia na Serikali ya Tanzania. “Barrick imekuwa na majadiliano na Serikali ya Tanzania kwa miaka miwili iliyopita kutafuta suluhu ya kudumu kwenye mgogoro wake na Acacia ili uzalishaji uendelee kama kawaida na kurudisha uhusiano ulio kuwapo zamani,” ilisema sehemu ya taarifa hiyo ya Rais na Ofisa Mtendaji Mkuu wa Barrick.Kutokana na hali hiyo, Barrick Gold itatekeleza yote yaliyopo katika makubaliano na Serikali ya Tanzania ambayo ilikuwa na hisa ya asilimia 16 ambayo imetaka ilipwe na malipo ya Dola milioni 300 sawa na Sh bilioni 682.5 pamoja na hisa asilimia 50 kwa 50, makubaliano hayo yalifikiwa Oktoba 19, mwaka 2017. Bristow alisema miradi yote ya Acacia iliyopo Tanzania itakuwa sehemu ya Barrick kwa Ukanda wa Afrika na Mashariki ya Kati na itasimamiwa na Willem Jackob pamoja na ile ya nchi nyingine za Afrika. Akizungumza na gazeti hili, Mwanasheria wa Kujitegemea kutoka Kampuni ya Uwakili ya Century Attorneys, Abdul Lyana alisema “Barrick ndio baba wa Acacia, baba ameshasema watatekeleza yote yanayotakiwa na serikali, baba akishasema mtoto hana sauti.”
Aliongeza, “Siku za nyuma serikali ilikuwa inapokea mrabaha tu, lakini baada ya Rais Magufuli kutoa tamko na kusitisha uendeshaji hata hisa zao ziliporomoka, ndio maana wameamua kukubaliana na masharti ili waweze kuendelea na shughuli zao, kwa hili tumpongeze Rais Magufuli kusimamia rasilimali za nchi yetu.” Katika andiko lake katika mitandao ya kijamii jana, mwandishi aliyejitambulisha kama Mwamba wa Kaska zini alisema, “Lakini hatimaye msimamo mwingine madhubuti wa Rais Magufuli aliyeamua kukaa upande wa wanyonge umeleta haki kwa mamilioni ya Watanzania.” Aliongeza, “Msimamo huu wa rais juu ya rasilimali za wanyonge uliungwa mkono na wengi lakini ukapingwa na wachache.”Mchambuzi wa masuala ya kisiasa nchini ambaye pia ni Mhadhiri Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salama Dk Benson Bana akizungumzia suala hilo alisema inadhihirisha uwapo wa udhaifu katika menejimenti yao na mahusiano kati yao na serikali ya Tanzania.Kwa maamuzi ya Barrick na nia waliyoionesha kuheshimu taratibu nzuri na makubalino yote yaliyokuwa yamefikiwa kwa maslahi ya wananchi na serikali kunaonesha juhudi za rais Magufuli zinafanikiwa.“Hii ndio dhamira njema ya Rais kuhakikisha kwamba rasilimali za nchi zinatumika kwa manufaa ya watanzania, nafurahi mtendaji mkuu wa Barrick ameonyesha nia njema ya kubadilisha muelekeo, falsafa na kukidhi kiu ya watanzania” alisema..Tangu alipoingia madarakani Rais Magufuli aliweka wazi nia yake ya kulinda rasilimali za Tanzania zikiwamo madini kwa kuzibana kampuni zilizowekeza nchini kutekeleza masharti na sheria za nchi kuhusu madini, na kuwapo na faida kwa Watanzania badala ya kuwanyonya Watanzania wenye rasilimali zao.","FINALLY, Acacia Mining plc and all its operations have become an official part of Barrick Gold Corporation and now owns all the shares, which is a step to agree with the arguments of President John Magufuli's Government regarding mineral resources to benefit Tanzanians. This has been made clear in a statement issued yesterday September 13, 2019 by the President and Chief Executive Officer of Barrick Gold, Mark Bristow based in Toronto in Canada. In that statement, Bristow said Barrick Gold Corporation has decided to buy Acacia Mining plc to facilitate reaching an agreement between the companies that with the Government of Tanzania in resolving the commercial dispute that existed between the two parties. In early May this year, Barrick submitted a request to buy 35 percent of Acacia's shares in order to have one voice in resolving the dispute that lasted for more than two years between Acacia and the Tanzanian Government. ""Barrick has been in discussions with the Government of Tanzania for the past two years to find a permanent solution to its dispute with Acacia so that production can continue as usual and restore the relationship that existed in the past,"" said part of the statement by the President and Chief Executive Officer of Barrick. and in that situation, Barrick Gold will implement all that is in the agreement with the Government of Tanzania which had a 16 percent share which it has requested to be paid with a payment of 300 million dollars equal to Sh 682.5 billion with a 50 percent for 50 share, the agreement was reached on October 19, in 2017. Bristow said all Acacia projects in Tanzania will be part of Barrick's Africa and Middle East region and will be managed by Willem Jacob along with those in other African countries. Speaking to this newspaper, Independent Lawyer from the Century Attorneys Law Firm, Abdul Lyana said ""Barrick is Acacia's father, the father has already said that they will implement everything required by the government, when the father says the child has no voice.""
He added, ""In the past, the government was only receiving royalties, but after President Magufuli made a statement and stopped operations even when their shares collapsed, that is why they have decided to agree to the conditions so that they can continue with their activities, for this let us congratulate President Magufuli for managing the resources of our country .” In his article on social media yesterday, the writer who identified himself as Mwamba wa Kaska zini said, ""But finally another strong position of President Magufuli who decided to stay on the side of the weak has brought justice to millions of Tanzanians."" He added, ""This position of the president on the resources of the poor was supported by many but opposed by a few."" An analyst of political issues in the country who is also a Lecturer at the University of Dar es Salama, Dr. Benson Bana, speaking about the issue, said it shows the presence of weakness in their management and the relationship between them and the Tanzanian government. With Barrick's decisions and the intention they showed to respect good procedures and all the agreements that had been reached in the interests of the people and the government, it shows that the efforts of President Magufuli are successful. ""This is the good intention of the President to ensure that the resources of countries are being used for the benefit of Tanzanians, I am glad the chief executive of Barrick has shown good intentions to change the direction, philosophy and satisfy the thirst of Tanzanians"" he said.. Since he came to power President Magufuli made clear his intention to protect Tanzania's resources including minerals by restricting the companies that invested in the country to implement the conditions and laws of the country regarding minerals, and to exist and benefits for Tanzanians instead of exploiting Tanzanians with their resources."

"KINSHASA, Congo DRC UKIWA umebaki muda usiozidi mwezi mmoja  kabla ya uchaguzi mkuu uliosubiriwa kwa muda mrefu nchini hapa, kiongozi mkuu wa upinzani, Felix Tshisekedi anatarajiwa kurejea  mjini   kuzindua kampeni zake akigombea nafasi ya urais. Felix Tshisekedi ni mtoto wa Etienne Tshisekedi, aliyefariki dunia mwaka jana baada ya kutumikia miongo kadhaa katika kambi ya upinzani nchini. Felix  ataingia kwenye kinyang’anyiro cha urais na mwenzake, Vital Kamerhe kama mgombea mwenza. Habari zilizopatikana mjini hapa zinaeleza kwamba Feilix na  Kamerhe, wa chama cha UNC,  wanatarajiwa kuzindua kampeni zao kwa pamoja, baada ya makubaliano ya kuunganisha nguvu hali ambayo wengi wanaitazama kuwa italeta mgawanyiko   wa kura  za wapinzania  katika uchaguzi mkuu wa mwezi ujao. Hatua hiyo imekuja ikiwa ni   miezi minne tangu vyama vya upinzani vikubaliane   kusimamisha mgombea mmoja ambako Mbunge aliyekuwa hajulikani na wengi, Martin Fayulu, aliteuliwa kugombea nafasi ya urais kwa niaba ya muungano wa vyama vyote. Hata hivyo muda mfupi baada ya makubaliano hayo,  vyama vya UDPS na UNC vilijitoa kwenye muungano huo. Tshisekedi sasa atawania nafasi ya urais kwa makubaliano kwamba Kamerhe atakuwa waziri mkuu wake . Mpaka sasa ni wagombea 19  wanaowania nafasi moja ya urais  akiwamo mgombea wa chama tawala, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. Taarifa zilizopo nchini hapa na za kutoka kwa mwandishi wa Shirika la Utangazaji la Uingereza (BBC), Mbelechi Msochi, zinasema  vyama vya upinzani vinalalamika kutokuwa na fedha  za kuendesha kampeni zao. Kwa sababu hiyo vinajibana  na fedha ndogo vilivyo nayo mpaka wiki mbili kabla ya uchaguzi ndipo vitakapoingia mchuano wa  kunadi sera zao kabla ya kuingia kwenye uchaguzi. Uchaguzi huo ambao umecheleweshwa kwa miaka miwili  sasa unatarajiwa kufanyika Desemba 23 mwaka huu.","KINSHASA, Congo DRC WITH less than a month left before the long-awaited general election in this country, the main opposition leader, Felix Tshisekedi is expected to return to the city to launch his campaign running for the presidency. Felix Tshisekedi is the son of Etienne Tshisekedi, who died last year after serving decades in the opposition camp in the country. Felix will enter the presidential race with his colleague, Vital Kamerhe as a co-candidate. The news obtained in this town explains that Feilix and Kamerhe, of the UNC party, are expected to launch their campaigns together, after the agreement to join forces, a situation that many see as dividing the votes of the opponents in next month's general election. The action has come four months since the opposition parties agreed to suspend one candidate where the Member of Parliament who was unknown to many, Martin Fayulu, was nominated to run for the presidency on behalf of the coalition of all parties. However, shortly after the agreement, the UDPS and UNC parties withdrew from the coalition. Tshisekedi will now run for the presidency with the agreement that Kamerhe will be his prime minister. Until now, there are 19 candidates vying for one presidential position, including the candidate of the ruling party, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. Information available in this country and from the correspondent of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Mbelechi Msochi, says that the opposition parties complain of not having funds to run their campaigns. Because of that, they are tight with the little money they have until two weeks before the election, when they will enter the competition to bid their policies before entering the election. The election, which has been delayed for two years, is now expected to be held on December 23 this year."

Alivitaja vigezo sita muhimu vya mwanamke anayemuhitaji kuwa ni awe mcha Mungu na mwenye kutunza watoto wake. “Vigezo vingine awe na sifa ya ndoa, awe na sifa ya mume, awe na sifa ya kilimo, awe na sifa ya kutunza watoto na awe na sifa ya usafi wa hali ya juu. “Tangu kuanza nimepata wanawake zaidi ya 30 ambao wanne kati yao wamefika hapa nyumbani kwangu, lakini wengine wamekuwa wakiona aibu kuja hapa moja kwa moja na hivyo wamekuwa wakitumia simu. Leo (jana) nimewafanyia usaili wanawake watano kwa simu, lakini hakuna hata aliyefuzu nusu ya vigezo, wengi wamekuwa wakiteleza sifa ya kilimo,” alisema.","And FARAJA MASINDE-DAR ES SALAAM MZEE Athuman Mchambua (76), who has posted an ad in his home looking for a wife, has added a new condition to the wife he needs. He has said that despite receiving many calls from different parts of the country, he has asked the women he will interview, especially the one who will win, not to hesitate as he will be in the transition period of his marriage. Speaking during a special interview with MTANZANIA yesterday at his home in Mtoni Mtongani, Dar es Salaam, Mzege Mchambua said he has reached that stage to start going through the names of more than 30 women who have already tried their luck to marry him. He said that he no longer sees the need to continue posting the ad because a large percentage of women who show up fail to meet the criteria he needs. He mentioned six important criteria for a woman who needs him to be God-fearing and take care of her children. ""Other criteria are that he should have the quality of marriage, he should have the quality of a husband, he should have the quality of agriculture, he should have the quality of taking care of children and he should have the quality of high cleanliness. ""Since I started, I have found more than 30 women, four of whom have come here to my house, but others have been ashamed to come here directly and so they have been using the phone. Today (yesterday) I interviewed five women over the phone, but none of them even qualified half of the criteria, most of them have been slipping the reputation of agriculture,"" he said."
"KENTUCKY, MAREKANI KARIBU katika safu hii ya Nje ya Box, ambayo inakuletea mada na makala mbalimbali zitakazokufanya ufikiri kwa upana huku ukipewa mwangu wa kutazama mambo kwa jicho la tatu. Jerry Medard ni  miongoni mwa vijana waliojiongeza na kufanikiwa kuwa mshereheshaji (MC) pendwa kwenye Mji wa Louisville, Kentucky nchini Marekani baada ya kumaliza chuo cha Columbus Technical College mwaka 2012. Akizungumza na safu hii, Jerry  ambaye alizaliwa Jamhuri ya Kidemokrasia ya Kongo na kukulia Mkoa wa Kigoma, Tanzania mwaka 1999 kabla hayakwenda Marekani, anasema alipoingia nchini humo alipata usumbufu wa kutokuwa karibu na Waafrika wanaozungumza Kiswahili. “Wengi niliowakuta walikuwa wanatoka Uganda, Malawi, Burundi, Rwanda na Somalia. Mwaka 2012 nilifanya kazi na nikawa na hamu ya kusoma kwahiyo nilikwenda chuo na baada ya kumaliza nikawa nafikiria nitafanya kitu gani kwa sababu bado nilikuwa na mambo ya ujana, mama akawa amenikumbusha kwamba nina vipaji mbalimbali pia familia yangu ni watu wa imani ni walokole wa Pentekoste. “Nikajikuta nina wito wa kumtumikia Mungu hapa Marekani na ilipofika 2017 nikapata maono ya kuanzisha kanisa langu nikishirikiana na shirika moja  la kiimani ambalo lipo Tanzania, Afrika Kusini, Kongo DRC, Rwanda  na nchi nyingi na mpaka sasa hivi ninaendelea kama Muinjilisti na Katibu wa kanisa,” anasema. Anasema aligundua ana nguvu ya ushawishi wa kuongea jambo na watu wakamsikiliza na kufurahi hivyo alitumia nafasi hiyo kuingia kwenye sanaa ya ushereheshaji. “Nilipata pia maoni kutoka kwa wazee wakaniambia Jerry una kitu ndani yako, na hicho kitu ni usemaji wako maana unaposimama mbele za watu wazima, viongozi watu wanakuwa makini kukusikiliza na kukuamini, hapo nikajua kwamba ninakubalika kwa asilimia 97, hapo nikapata hilo wazo la kuingia kwenye tasnia ya ushereheshaji. “Mara ya kwanza kuwa MC nilikwenda nje ya Kentury kufungisha ndoa, nilipofika kule harusi ilikuwa nzuri ila watu waliotakiwa wasimamie hawakuwa tayari, mimi nikaenda kwa watumishi wa Mungu wenzangu nikawaambia hayo madhaifu, nilikuwa sijaandaliwa, niliwaongoza maharusi vizuri mpaka kwenye madhabahu ndoa ikabarikiwa kisha tukaenda ukumbini, tukakuta mambo mabaya, ikabidi waniombe tena nisimamie na pale, nikubali kusimamia mwanzo mpaka mwisho kama Mc, nikafanyavizuri na baada ya hapo watu wengi walichukua namba zangu, wakitaka huduma yangu,” Jerry anasema katika jamii wa waafrika hakukuwa na kitu kama Mc, hivyo yeye aliamua kutumia fursa hiyo kuanzisha kampuni ya ushereheshaji ambayo mpaka sasa inafanya vizuri nchini Marekani. “Nilipata maono ya kuwa Mc kwa sababu kwenye jamii ya watu wanaozungumza Kiswahili hakukuwa na kitu kama hicho,” anasema Jerry. Akaongeza kuwa maandamano ya watu weusi pamoja na corona kutikisa Marekani, kumrudisha nyuma kwa sababu kazi yake inahusisha watu wengi. “Corona imeathiri vitu vingi sana kwenye maisha yetu binafsi, mimi nilikuwa nina harusi mbili nilizotakiwa kusisimamia kabla ya corona ambazo zilisitishwa pia kazi zote kwenye kampuni zilisimamishwa kwa upande wa George Floyd mimi imeniathiri kwa asilimia ndogo ila kwa Wamarekani weusi wazawa ndio wameathirika,” anasema. Akizungumzia Mc maarufu waliomvutia zaidi kufanya kazi hiyo, Jerry anasema: “Napenda na kutamani, waafrika huku tunavyoishi ni kwamba Wakongomani wakiwa na harusi wanajitafuta wenyewe na Watanzania wakiwa na sherehe wanajitafuta wenyewe kwahiyo ningetamani na kwa sababu napenda Tanzania ndio nchi niliyokulia kuna Mc wazuri ambao nawakubali Mc Luvanda napenda sherehe zake na Mc Pilipili naye napenda maneno yake anapofanya kazi ningetamani tushirikiane siku moja.” ","KENTUCKY, UNITED STATES WELCOME to this Out of the Box series, which brings you various topics and articles that will make you think broadly while giving you the light to look at things with a third eye. Jerry Medard is one of the young people who became a popular MC in Louisville, Kentucky in the United States after graduating from Columbus Technical College in 2012. Speaking to this column, Jerry who was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and grew up in the region of Kigoma, Tanzania in 1999 before going to the United States, says that when he entered the country, he felt the discomfort of not being close to Africans who speak Kiswahili. ""Most of them I met were from Uganda, Malawi, Burundi, Rwanda and Somalia. In 2012 I was working and I wanted to study so I went to college and after I finished I was thinking about what I would do because I was still young, my mother reminded me that I have different talents and my family are people of faith and Pentecost survivors. ""I found myself called to serve God here in the United States and when it came to 2017 I got a vision to start my own church collaborating with one faith organization that is in Tanzania, South Africa, Congo DRC, Rwanda and many countries and until now I continue as an Evangelist and Secretary of the church, ” he says. He says he realized he has the power of persuasion to speak and people listened to him and were happy, so he used that opportunity to enter the art of celebration. ""I also got comments from elders who told me Jerry you have something in you, and that something is your speech because when you stand in front of adults, leaders, people are careful to listen to you and trust you, then I knew that I was accepted by 97 percent, then I got the idea of ​​entering the entertainment industry. ""The first time I became an MC I went outside Kentury to solemnize a marriage, when I got there the wedding was good but the people who were supposed to officiate were not ready, I went to my fellow servants of God and told them about the weaknesses, I was not prepared, I led the bride and groom well until the altar and the marriage was blessed and then we went to the hall , we found bad things, and they had to ask me again to manage and there, agree to manage from start to finish as Mc, I did well and after that many people took my numbers, wanting my service,"" Jerry says in the African community there was nothing like Mc, so he he decided to use the opportunity to start an entertainment company that is still doing well in the United States. ""I had a vision of becoming a MC because there was no such thing in the Kiswahili-speaking community,"" says Jerry. He added that the protests of black people along with corona will shake the United States, bringing him back because his work involves many people. ""Corona has affected a lot of things in our personal lives, I had two weddings that I was supposed to manage before corona that were stopped and all the work in the company was stopped on the part of George Floyd. It has affected me in a small percentage, but the native black Americans are the ones who have been affected,"" he says. Talking about the famous Mc who attracted him the most to do the job, Jerry says: ""I like and wish, Africans where we live is that the Congolese are looking for themselves when they are having a wedding and the Tanzanians are looking for themselves when they are having a party so I would like to and because I like Tanzania is the country I grew up there are good Mc who I accept Mc Luvanda I like his parties and Mc Pilipili and I like his words when he works, I wish we could work together one day."""

Kongamano hilo linajadili njia bora na salama za kina mama kujifungua. Akifungua kongamano hilo, Margaret Kenyatta ambaye ni mke wa Rais Uhuru Kenyatta, alisema upo uwezekeno mkubwa wa kukabili vifo vya wajawazito na watoto ifikapo mwaka 2030 iwapo njia mbadala zitachangiwa na Waafrika wenyewe. Kwa kila watoto 1,000 wanaozaliwa nchini Kenya, 22 hufariki dunia kabla ya kufikisha mwezi mmoja huku 193,000 wakizaliwa kabla ya siku zao. “Kaulimbiu ya leo inakwenda sambamba na mikakati yangu ya kupunguza idadi ya vifo kwa wanawake wanaojifungua na kila mtoto anastahili kuishi zaidi ya miaka mitano. “Ni vita ambavyo nimekuwa nikipigana navyo kwa muda wa miaka mitano sasa, na leo naongezea sauti yangu kwenye vita hivi, naamini kuwa kila mama na kila mtoto anastahili kuishi na kushamiri,” alisema Margaret. Serikali ya Uingereza imetoa dola milioni 15 kwa mpango wa kupunguza vifo vya kina mama wanaojifungua nchini hapa. Kongamano hilo linafuatia lile ambalo lilifanyika Afrika Kusini miaka mitano iliyopita, huku wanawake 550 wakiripotiwa kufa kila siku kutokana na matatizo ya ujauzito katika mataifa yaliyoko chini ya jangwa la Sahara. Kenya imetajwa kuwa mfano kwa mataifa mengine ya Afrika huku mfumo wa ugatuzi ukichangia kuboresha sekta ya afya mashinani, hasa katika majimbo yaliyoko kaskazini ambayo yalikuwa na viwango vikubwa vya vifo vya wajawazito na watoto kutokana na uhaba wa vifaa.

This was said at the Second International Conference on Africa that started in this city the other day and was attended by delegates from 25 countries and about 1,000 partners. . The conference discusses the best and safest ways for mothers to give birth. Opening the conference, Margaret Kenyatta, who is the wife of President Uhuru Kenyatta, said there is a high possibility of facing deaths of pregnant women and children by 2030 if alternative ways are contributed by Africans themselves. For every 1,000 children born in Kenya, 22 die before reaching one month of age while 193,000 are born prematurely. ""Today's theme goes in line with my strategies to reduce the number of deaths for women who give birth and every child deserves to live more than five years. ""It is a battle that I have been fighting for five years now, and today I add my voice to this battle, I believe that every mother and every child deserves to live and flourish,"" said Margaret. The British government has given 15 million dollars to a program to reduce the deaths of mothers who give birth in this country. The conference follows the one that was held in South Africa five years ago, with 550 women reportedly dying every day due to pregnancy complications in sub-Saharan Africa. Kenya has been cited as an example for other African countries as the decentralization system contributes to improving the local health sector, especially in the states in the north that had high rates of maternal and child deaths due to a lack of equipment. The African Union Commission, which is sponsoring the conference together with the Government of Kenya, has said that it is cooperating with the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the World Food Organization as well as the wives of the presidents of the African continent to mobilize the citizens of the respective countries to reduce the deaths. The three-day conference will discuss other issues including leadership, responsibility, the virus that causes AIDS among children as well as early marriage and pregnancy."
