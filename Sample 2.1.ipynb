Statement by Kenya Airways (KQ) ) has stated that the passenger has arrived in Nairobi today, January 28, coming from Guangzhou in China, where the virus spread to a large extent. it shows that the passenger was allowed by the health authorities in Guanzhou to return to Kenya but when he arrived he showed symptoms similar to the disease. KQ has said that it took precautionary measures by isolating the passenger during the entire journey. So far, more than 100 people have been reported to have died due to the virus in China, while it is spreading to various parts of the world.']\n"
